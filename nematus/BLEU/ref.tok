$ 10,000 Gold ?
San FRANCISCO - It has never been easy to have a rational conversation about the value of gold .
Lately , with gold prices up more than 300 % over the last decade , it is harder than ever .
Just last December , fellow economists Martin Feldstein and Nouriel Roubini each penned op-eds bravely questioning bullish market sentiment , sensibly pointing out gold &apos;s risks .
Wouldn &apos;t you know it ?
Since their articles appeared , the price of gold has moved up still further . Gold prices even hit a record-high $ 1,300 recently .
Last December , many gold bugs were arguing that the price was inevitably headed for $ 2,000 .
Now , emboldened by continuing appreciation , some are suggesting that gold could be headed even higher than that .
One successful gold investor recently explained to me that stock prices languished for a more than a decade before the Dow Jones index crossed the 1,000 mark in the early 1980 &quot; s .
Since then , the index has climbed above 10,000 .
Now that gold has crossed the magic $ 1,000 barrier , why can &apos;t it increase ten-fold , too ?
Admittedly , getting to a much higher price for gold is not quite the leap of imagination that it seems .
After adjusting for inflation , today &apos;s price is nowhere near the all-time high of January 1980 . Back then , gold hit $ 850 , or well over $ 2,000 in today &apos;s dollars .
But January 1980 was arguably a &quot; freak peak &quot; during a period of heightened geo-political instability .
At $ 1,300 , today &apos;s price is probably more than double very long-term , inflation-adjusted , average gold prices .
So what could justify another huge increase in gold prices from here ?
One answer , of course , is a complete collapse of the US dollar .
With soaring deficits , and a rudderless fiscal policy , one does wonder whether a populist administration might recklessly turn to the printing press .
And if you are really worried about that , gold might indeed be the most reliable hedge .
Sure , some might argue that inflation-indexed bonds offer a better and more direct inflation hedge than gold .
But gold bugs are right to worry about whether the government will honor its commitments under more extreme circumstances .
In fact , as Carmen Reinhart and I discuss in our recent book on the history of financial crises , This Time is Different , cash-strapped governments will often forcibly convert indexed debt to non-indexed debt , precisely so that its value might be inflated away .
Even the United States abrogated indexation clauses in bond contracts during the Great Depression of the 1930 &quot; s .
So it can happen anywhere .
Even so , the fact that very high inflation is possible does not make it probable , so one should be cautious in arguing that higher gold prices are being driven by inflation expectations .
Some have argued instead that gold &apos;s long upward march has been partly driven by the development of new financial instruments that make it easier to trade and speculate in gold .
There is probably some slight truth - and also a certain degree of irony - to this argument .
After all , medieval alchemists engaged in what we now consider an absurd search for ways to transform base metals into gold .
Wouldn &apos;t it be paradoxical , then , if financial alchemy could make an ingot of gold worth dramatically more ?
In my view , the most powerful argument to justify today &apos;s high price of gold is the dramatic emergence of Asia , Latin America , and the Middle East into the global economy .
As legions of new consumers gain purchasing power , demand inevitably rises , driving up the price of scarce commodities .
At the same time , emerging-market central banks need to accumulate gold reserves , which they still hold in far lower proportion than do rich-country central banks .
With the euro looking less appetizing as a diversification play away from the dollar , gold &apos;s appeal has naturally grown .
So , yes , there are solid fundamentals that arguably support today &apos;s higher gold price , although it is far more debatable whether and to what extent they will continue to support higher prices in the future .
Indeed , another critical fundamental factor that has been sustaining high gold prices might prove far more ephemeral than globalization .
Gold prices are extremely sensitive to global interest-rate movements .
After all , gold pays no interest and even costs something to store .
Today , with interest rates near or at record lows in many countries , it is relatively cheap to speculate in gold instead of investing in bonds .
But if real interest rates rise significantly , as well they might someday , gold prices could plummet .
Most economic research suggests that gold prices are very difficult to predict over the short to medium term , with the odds of gains and losses being roughly in balance .
It is therefore dangerous to extrapolate from short-term trends .
Yes , gold has had a great run , but so , too , did worldwide housing prices until a couple of years ago .
If you are a high-net-worth investor , a sovereign wealth fund , or a central bank , it makes perfect sense to hold a modest proportion of your portfolio in gold as a hedge against extreme events .
But , despite gold &apos;s heightened allure in the wake of an extraordinary run-up in its price , it remains a very risky bet for most of us .
Of course , such considerations might have little influence on prices .
What was true for the alchemists of yore remains true today : Gold and reason are often difficult to reconcile .
A Conservative Europe
Last week Tony Blair , Jacques Chirac , and Gerhard Schroeder met in Berlin .
They departed pledging to revive Europe &apos;s growth . We &apos;ve heard that empty promise before .
Instead , the European Union needs a new direction .
I say this as leader of the party which has been at the forefront of Britain &apos;s engagement with Europe .
It was a Conservative government that first applied for membership in the early 1960 &apos;s .
A Conservative government took the United Kingdom into the European Economic Community in 1973 .
Margaret Thatcher worked with Jacques Delors to forge the Single Market in 1986 .
So I have no doubt that Britain must remain influential within the Union .
But British policy towards the EU has often led to worse rather than better relations among member states .
Faced with a new EU initiative , our traditional response has often been to oppose it , vote against it , lose the vote , then sulkily to adopt it while blaming everyone else .
Many Europeans are sick of British vetoes . So am I.
Of course there are basic requirements that all member states must accept .
Foremost are the four freedoms of the single market ; free movement of goods , services , people and capital .
But a single market does not require a single social or industrial policy , far less a common taxation policy .
Allowing countries to pursue their own policies in these areas encourages competitiveness .
Forcing common standards means that Europe will fall further behind as member states shuffle their costs onto their neighbours .
Which areas should be applied to every member state , and which should be optional ?
I believe that every member state should administer those policies that do not directly and significantly affect other member states .
In areas which serve their national interest , individual members should decide whether to retain wholly national control or whether to co ‑ operate with others .
The Union &apos;s members should form a series of overlapping circles : Different combinations of members should be able to pool their responsibilities in different areas of their own choosing .
Precedents exist for this .
NATO has been flexible since its inception .
France signed up for membership but later refused to submit her armed forces to NATO &apos;s central command .
Similar flexibility exists with the Euro , the Schengen Agreement , and the Social Chapter .
These precedents can be extended .
So far , everyone has had to move forward together , with individual countries negotiating specific opt ‑ outs .
But since 1998 , there has been a procedure within the Treaties - called enhanced co ‑ operation - that could allow some members to go ahead with further integration in a specific area without involving every other member .
Instead of individual member states having fraught negotiations to opt ‑ out of a new initiative , those that support it can simply opt ‑ in .
Countries that want to integrate further can do so .
They don &apos;t need to drag Britain and others kicking and screaming in their wake because the others are not compelled to join them .
In this way we can break free of the institutionalised tug of war that has characterised EU relations .
I am not talking about a two ‑ speed Europe . That implies that we all agree on the destination and differ only about the speed of the journey .
I don &apos;t want to reach the destination that some of our partners may aspire to . But I don &apos;t want to block their way .
There are some who say that this would mean a loss of influence on the part of those countries which choose not to integrate more closely .
But influence is not an end in itself - it is a means to an end .
Britain does not need a seat at the table when decisions on the Euro are taken .
Our economy has not been adversely affected by staying out .
Keeping the pound does not mean that we oppose the Euro , or hope for its failure .
The European Union should stop trying to do everything and concentrate on doing fewer things more effectively .
It should give member states the chance to develop an approach to Europe that suits their national traditions , within the EU framework .
It is on this basis that British Conservatives oppose the proposed constitution .
We disagree with many of its contents , of course , but also oppose the idea of having an EU constitution at all .
There is a world of difference between an association of nation states bound together by treaty , and a single entity , whether you call it a state or not , with its own legal personality , deriving its authority from its own constitution .
If this constitution were accepted in anything like the proposed form , the EU would gain many attributes and trappings of statehood : Its own president and foreign minister , its own legal system .
The supremacy of EU law would derive not from Acts of national Parliaments but from a supra ‑ national constitution .
That is a radical change , not the mere tidying ‑ up exercise some suggest .
I do not believe it is right to make a change of such magnitude without specifically consulting the people on whose behalf we govern .
Elected parliaments do not own our liberties .
They safeguard them , and should not diminish those liberties without an explicit mandate .
Any proposal for a new constitution must be put to the British people and to the people in each EU member state .
­ A New European Growth Agenda
Brussels - austerity alone cannot solve Europe &apos;s economic and financial crisis .
Growth and jobs need to be promoted with equal zeal .
European Union leaders now recognize this : Kick-starting growth in 2012 was high on the agenda at the European Council &apos;s meeting on January 30 .
But the big question remains : How ?
The need for immediate action is clear .
The eurozone &apos;s economy contracted in the last three months of 2011 ; even Germany &apos;s shrank .
The new year is looking grim .
France is flat-lining ( as is Britain ) .
Italy and Spain have sunk into deep recession .
Greece is in its fifth year of a slump .
And eurozone unemployment is at record highs , with nearly one in two young people jobless in Spain and Greece .
The economic headwinds are formidable : Fiscal austerity , high interest rates outside AAA-rated countries , credit cutting by banks , deleveraging households , weak private-sector investment , and declining exports as the global slowdown undermines demand .
Until growth resumes , any tentative financial stabilization will be extremely fragile .
Recession will hit banks &quot; and governments &quot; already-weak balance sheets , increasing pressure for faster deleveraging .
But , while gradual adjustment is essential , faster and deeper cuts are largely self-defeating : Big reductions in private credit and government spending will cause a sharper slowdown - and thus a vicious downward spiral .
A big new push for growth is therefore vital .
So far , the growth agenda has consisted largely of structural reforms , which are essential for boosting future productivity and flexibility .
The crisis does provide a political opportunity for bold moves on this front in many countries ; but structural reforms generally will not generate growth and jobs immediately ( one exception is permitting shops to open longer ) .
On the contrary , a shakeout of less productive jobs , for example , would at first raise unemployment , increase government outlays , and reduce private spending .
And , because demand is depressed , credit is in short supply , and barriers to enterprise are often high , it will take longer than usual for businesses to create more productive jobs .
In short , structural reforms alone cannot be relied upon to stimulate growth in 2012 .
Instead , the immediate focus needs to be on boosting investment and exports in economies with a current-account deficit - such as France , Italy , and Spain ( and the United Kingdom ) - and stimulating consumption in surplus countries such as Germany and the Netherlands .
The European Central Bank has acted decisively to prop up European banks ; now it needs to support the real economy , too .
While official interest rates are only 1 % , solvent sovereigns such as Spain pay more than 5 % to borrow for ten years , while creditworthy businesses in Italy can borrow only at punitive rates , if at all .
So the ECB should do more to unblock the transmission mechanism for monetary policy ; the European Banking Authority should discourage excessive deleveraging by insisting that banks raise specific capital amounts rather than hit a uniform 9 % ratio ; and , where necessary , national governments should provide guarantees for bank lending to small and medium-size businesses .
While improving access to finance is vital , governments also need to do more to boost investment .
They should prioritize measures to make it easier to start a business , lift barriers to venture capital , and introduce temporary 100 % capital allowances to encourage businesses to bring forward investment .
At the EU level , the ( callable ) capital of the European Investment Bank should be greatly increased , as European Commission President José Manuel Barroso suggested in his State of the Union speech last September , so that the EIB can finance a big wave of pan-European investment , notably in infrastructure .
Boosting exports is also essential .
Deficit countries need to become more competitive , increasing productivity while cutting costs .
A more competitive currency would be welcome : Just as the sterling &apos;s collapse since 2008 has lifted UK exports , a weaker euro would help Mediterranean economies regain competitiveness for price-sensitive exports .
A fiscal devaluation - slashing payroll taxes and replacing the revenues with a higher VAT - would also help .
Surplus countries , too , must do their part , which is in their own interest .
Just as China needs to allow the renminbi to rise , so Germany - whose current-account surplus exceeds China &apos;s both as a share of GDP and in absolute terms - needs a higher real exchange rate .
That means that Germans need to earn higher wages , commensurate with their increased productivity , so that they can afford more Greek and Spanish holidays .
If businesses will not oblige , an income-tax cut would do the trick .
That brings us to fiscal policy .
Governments that cannot borrow cheaply ( or at all ) from markets have no option but to tighten their belts .
But they should pursue smart consolidation rather than unthinking austerity .
So they should maintain investment in skills and infrastructure , while cutting subsidies and transfer payments .
They should also legislate now for future reforms , notably to encourage people to work longer .
Last but not least , governments that can borrow at unprecedentedly low rates - 0 % in real terms over 10 years in the case of Germany - must play their role in supporting demand .
Would it be really be so difficult to see VAT coming down ahead of the German election next year ?
Is Iraq the Next Afghanistan ?
At the onset of the US-led war in Iraq , two competing views shaped predictions about the outcome . The first contended that overthrowing Saddam Hussein &apos;s regime would usher in a democratic era in Iraq that would serve as a model and catalyst for democratic change regionally .
Derided by detractors as a new &quot; domino theory , &quot; this view presented intervention in Iraq as similar to America &apos;s role in post-WWII Japan .
Against the optimism of that &quot; Japan scenario , &quot; pessimists argued that a &quot; Somalia scenario &quot; was more likely .
They staked their claim on the tribal , sectarian , and multiethnic nature of Iraq , which , in the absence of dictatorship , would supposedly incite Iraq &apos;s collapse into a &quot; failed state , &quot; with rampant warlordism , ethnic and religious feuds , and harboring of terrorist organizations .
But the main question now is whether Iraq will drift along lines somewhere between these two scenarios , increasingly resembling Afghanistan .
This &quot; Afghan scenario &quot; implies a weak state with nominal power over effectively autonomous fiefdoms that are headed by strongmen who are represented in the central government .
Bad as it sounds , this prospect appears to be a &quot; realistic &quot; compromise between the supposedly utopian vision of a flourishing , unified democracy and the wretchedness of a failed state .
Many of the actions and policies of the Coalition Provisional Authority ( CPA ) , as well as higher-level Bush administration decisions , seem to point to a resigned acceptance that early hopes that Iraq would embrace Western-style democracy were misplaced .
Indeed , such hopes were misplaced .
Iraq &apos;s political culture - and that of most of the Middle East - is incompatible with the basic components of a recognizable Western-style democracy : Notions of individual rights and responsibilities are lacking , the concept of a patriarchal state is deeply rooted , and individual cultural identity is rarely tied to the national community .
On the other hand , much circular logic figures in analyses that consider the &quot; traditional &quot; nature of Iraqi society an obstacle to liberal democracy .
For these analyses are hardly neutral , but unwittingly enter an ongoing confrontation .
In Iraq , as elsewhere in the Arab and Muslim worlds , a cultural war is being waged between two paradigms : Grand narratives that accept and promote a collectivistic understanding ( nationalism , socialism , Islamism ) , versus an implicit paradigm of individualistic modernity that is locally rooted yet informed by the global experience .
The frontlines of this war are notions of the individual , cultural identity , civil society , and the nation-state .
The religious Islamic component in Iraqi social life should not be underestimated . But it also should not be equated with the political Islamism that strives to capitalize on it .
Nationalist and leftist political discourses did leave an imprint on the Iraqi value system , but they are not its sole components .
Indeed , the nominal acceptance of grand narratives of &quot; democracy &quot; and &quot; human rights &quot; as common bases for political discourse represents a crucial shift in demarcating the cultural battle .
This cultural debate is not limited to the Arab scene .
There are also vigorous discussions in the West about the applicability of democratic institutions to the Arab context .
Advocates of the notion of &quot; Arab exceptionalism , &quot; which questions the ability of Arab societies to adapt democratic systems are in fact objectively allied with &quot; grand narrative &quot; ideologues - and also with the beneficiaries of the Arab world &apos;s patronage-based political order .
The models used in the West , both in political circles and in academia , for the analysis and interpretation of Arab societies are seriously deficient .
In particular , many analyses nowadays promote an ethnic model , reducing Iraq to an artificial construct that rests atop a fragmented &quot; reality &quot; of separate communities .
Some have even suggested hastening the outcome predicted by this faulty view by dividing Iraq into its &quot; genuine &quot; original components : Sunni , Shi &apos;i , and Kurd .
In fact , Iraqi society is more complex than this .
The reception and adoption of democracy is not a function of sectarian belonging , but a reflection of the multi-dimensional historical , cultural , religious , and political identities of Iraqi individuals .
Given the right circumstances , it is eminently possible to mobilize Iraqi society towards a democratic formulation of its state-to-be .
The fall of Saddam ushers in the right circumstances .
Indeed , the seeming failure of a recognizable democratic core to emerge in Iraq within the first few months of the collapse of Saddam &apos;s dictatorship is due more to idiosyncrasies of the process than to any presumed essential nature of Iraqi society .
Upon Saddam &apos;s fall , a large &quot; middle ground &quot; existed in Iraq that was positively disposed towards democratic discourse and practice .
Policy mistakes and reversals eroded this middle ground , opening a path for ideological Islamism and a reconstituted neo-Ba &apos;athism .
The key mistake was the failure of occupation forces to equip and empower the small group of Iraqi liberal democratic figures to tap into this middle ground .
As a result , the space for a liberal democratic outcome receded .
But to treat this setback as a failure would be a self-fulfilling prophecy .
Iraqi democrats must re-assess and develop a clear public strategy .
The CPA , and the world community , must not prejudice the outcome of their efforts by accepting a facile and bogus view of Iraqi society .
Even if such efforts succeed , the road to a full-fledged democratic system in Iraq will still be arduous and expensive .
But instead of succumbing to a &quot; Somalia scenario , &quot; dreaming of a &quot; Japan scenario , &quot; or settling for an &quot; Afghanistan scenario , &quot; Iraq may yet become a &quot; scenario &quot; for successful intervention in the 21 st century .
&quot; Neo-Ottoman &quot; Turkey ?
Ankara - Nowadays , the international media are obsessed with the question of who &quot; lost &quot; Turkey and what that supposed loss means for Europe and the West .
More alarmingly , some commentators liken Turkey &apos;s neighborhood policy to a revival of Ottoman imperialism .
Recently , a senior Turkish columnist went so far as to quote Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu as saying that &quot; we are indeed neo-Ottoman . &quot;
As someone who was present when Davutoğlu made his presentation to the parliamentary faction of Turkey &apos;s ruling Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) , I can attest to the fact that he did not use such terminology .
In fact , Davutoğlu and all of us in the AKP foreign-policy community never use this term , because it is simply a mispresentation of our position .
Turkey &apos;s neighborhood policy is devised to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighborhoods , including the Balkans , the Black Sea , the Caucasus , the Middle East , and the Eastern Mediterranean .
We aim to deepen our political dialogue , increase our trade , and multiply our people-to-people contacts with our neighbors in the form of sports , tourism , and cultural actvities .
When Egon Bahr formulated his Ostpolitik in the 1960 &quot; s , no one asked Will Brandt whether Germany was lost .
God bestowed upon Turkey a geographical position that fundamentally requires for us to engage with East and West , North and South .
This is neither a choice nor a luxury - it is a necessity .
The symbol of the Byzantine and the Selçuk Empires , which occupied roughly the same geography that Turkey does today , was a double-headed eagle looking both east and west .
It should be no wonder that Turkey is also seeking to engage both ends of its territories and feels that its security is best consolidated by minimizing risks together with its neighbors .
So we find the current debate on Turkey &apos;s orientation rather superflous , and in some cases ill-intentioned .
Our neighborhood policy needs support , not criticism .
Turkey has become an invaluable asset in the make-up of our surrounding regions , and is already changing the status quo in favor of more stability and predictability .
Our efforts at normalization with Armenia , for example , are destined to bring change to the entire South Caucasus .
We are doing our part in terms of burden-sharing .
Sensible Europeans understand that .
To be sure , some of our neighbors are difficult .
But no country has the luxury of choosing its neighbors .
Turkey &apos;s neighborhood policy is very realistic , based on genuine interests , not some romantic neo-Ottoman nostagia , as more than a few international commentators have suggested .
True , there is a neo-Ottoman revival in the cultural field , and our citizens are eager to rediscover Ottoman life , culture , and practices .
As Turkey is normalizing domestically , it is also reinterpreting its national historical narrative .
This is a natural byproduct of consolidating our democracy .
However , trying to paint our carefully constructed foreign-policy initiatives with imperialist overtones is not only a stark mispresentation , but also does gross injustice to our well-intentioned efforts to stabilize our region .
In Roman mythology , Janus was the god of gates , doorways , beginnings , and endings .
Turkey today is a Janus-like geography that offers gates and doorways to the East and West .
It offers beginnings and endings to the Caucasus , the Black Sea , the Balkans , and the Mediterranean .
In this capacity , Turkey complements and contributes to a unique transitional passage between otherwise difficult regions , for it signifies centuries-old co-existence and adjustment .
Turkish foreign policy contributes to that coming together and helps its immeditate neighborhoods to connect with one another .
Contrary to recent charges , Turkey &apos;s foreign policymakers are not seeking to revive the Ottoman Empire .
Instead , we seek Turkey &apos;s historic reintegration into its immediate neighborhoods , thereby correcting an anomaly of the Cold War years .
Such re-integration would only benefit the European Union and our other Western , NATO allies .
None of them , therefore , has any reason to express discomfort with Turkey .
Why Wait for the Euro ?
Although the EU &apos;s eastward enlargement has not yet happened , the debate is already shifting to ask what will follow : When should the new , predominantly postcommunist , members adopt the euro ?
Assuming that they comply with the Maastricht Treaty &apos;s provisions concerning the EMU - and are not unfairly held to more stringent criteria - the core issue is whether new members would benefit more by waiting or whether they should seek early entry .
At the outset , it must be stressed that , in seeking earlier entry into the EMU a country assumes a more ambitious fiscal and structural program than would be needed if EMU membership is delayed .
Early entry , otherwise , would be an empty gesture .
I believe that early adoption of the euro is not only possible , but preferable to delay .
By early adoption I mean the shortest permissible period of time - two years - following a new member subordinating its monetary policy to the fiscal and monetary constraints of the exchange rate mechanism ( erm II ) .
Assuming entry into both the EU and erm II in 2004 , new members should aim to enter the eurozone around 2006 .
Is this realistic ?
Well , most candidate countries have already achieved a high degree of structural convergence with the EU .
Exports to the Union have soared since 1991 , when the collapse of the Soviet-era COMECON trading system forced a radical reorientation of trade - helped by massive foreign investment from the EU - towards Western markets .
Most accession candidates now send more exports to the EU than Greece , Portugal , and Spain did when they entered the EU and EMU .
Progress on disinflation is similarly impressive .
Annual inflation in most candidate countries has fallen to 4-5 % - not much higher than in many EU countries , and lower than in The Netherlands last year .
As with structural convergence , EU candidates already outperform Spain , Portugal , and Greece at a comparable time before their EMU debut .
Nor is there much risk of large , future corrective price swings because all but a few prices are completely liberalized .
Theoretical studies suggest that inflation in the accession countries will remain stubbornly higher than the Maastricht Treaty allows .
The culprit in this pessimistic view is the so-called &quot; Balassa-Samuelson &quot; effect : Rapid productivity growth in the accession candidates &apos; tradable sectors - export manufacturing , for example - is pushing up real wages throughout their economies , including in non-tradable sectors like services .
This overall rise in real wages in the face of lower productivity growth for the service sector boosts relative prices and keeps inflation above the eurozone average .
The Balassa-Samuelson effect is still evident in Greece , Spain and Portugal .
But as empirical research prepared by the CEC5 National Banks estimates , its contribution to total price growth in the candidate countries is 1-2 % .
With the Balassa-Samuelson effect so subdued and limited scope for future corrective inflation , the EMU criterion regarding price stability - of annual inflation within 1.5 % of the average rate for the three best-performing economies in the EU - is within reach .
But is early admission to EMU preferable to postponing membership ?
From the standpoint of current member states , would admitting Hungary , Latvia , Poland , or Slovakia , sooner rather than later , drag down the euro as many fear ?
Fears that extending EMU to new states &quot; too soon &quot; would undermine the euro &apos;s external exchange rate are irrational .
If all candidate countries join the EU at around the same time , they will together account for a mere 6 % of its total GDP .
So any negative impact on the euro from rapid accession to EMU would at worst amount to little more than a rounding error .
Delaying entry into EMU could make sense if a longer wait produced more information .
But a wait of greater length might produce nothing but added noise .
Equally , the transition period is already turbulent , with convergence-driven capital flows driving up exchange rates and complicating monetary policy in several candidate countries , including Poland , the Czech Republic , and Hungary .
Indeed , capital-flow volatility could make short work of the flexible exchange rate on offer under erm II - a 15 % fluctuation band either side of a central parity .
Some argue that erm II membership should be viewed as a longer-term proposition - possibly lasting until 2010 - for the benefit of candidates themselves .
The benefit is simple : Erm II permits some exchange rate flexibility , as opposed to the fixed rates implied by adopting the euro .
This would help keep the candidates &apos; economic output high and thus sustain real convergence with average EU income levels .
This is an exceptionally weak argument , and a politically suspect one , too .
As European Central Bank data shows , average per capita GDP in the accession candidates is 44 % of the eurozone level .
The size of the income gap combines with the small growth differentials to imply that the process of real convergence will extend far beyond even the most cautious dates for EU and EMU entry , probably lasting several decades .
More important , long-lasting economic growth does not depend on the type of exchange rate - whether flexible or fixed ( EMU ) - while early accession will speed up crucial reforms .
A few years of limited exchange rate flexibility is a poor substitute for rapid completion of structural reforms .
In almost all candidates , further disinflation and long-term economic growth require fiscal consolidation , more flexible labor markets , and completion of privatization .
Delaying EMU entry risks weakening the incentive to complete these politically costly but necessary reforms .
Any delay in completing reforms will ultimately slow the process of real convergence that EU officials rightly hold dear .
Early adoption , by contrast , would be more conducive to these reforms , and thus to real convergence .
Success here would allow candidate countries to start reaping the benefits of greater price transparency , reduced transaction costs , and a solid macroeconomic framework .
This strategy , not one of deferred entry , promises the most for both the EU &apos;s current and its future members .
1929 or 1989 ?
Paris - As the economic crisis deepens and widens , the world has been searching for historical analogies to help us understand what has been happening .
At the start of the crisis , many people likened it to 1982 or 1973 , which was reassuring , because both dates refer to classical cyclical downturns .
Today , the mood is much grimmer , with references to 1929 and 1931 beginning to abound , even if some governments continue to behave as if the crisis was more classical than exceptional .
The tendency is either excessive restraint ( Europe ) or a diffusion of the effort ( the United States ) .
Europe is being cautious in the name of avoiding debt and defending the euro , whereas the US has moved on many fronts in order not to waste an ideal opportunity to implement badly needed structural reforms .
For geo-strategists , however , the year that naturally comes to mind , in both politics and economics , is 1989 .
Of course , the fall of the house of Lehman Brothers has nothing to do with the fall of the Berlin Wall .
Indeed , on the surface it seems to be its perfect antithesis : The collapse of a wall symbolizing oppression and artificial divisions versus the collapse of a seemingly indestructible and reassuring institution of financial capitalism .
Yet 2008-2009 , like 1989 , may very well correspond to an epochal change , whose unfolding consequences will be felt for decades .
The end of the East-West ideological divide and the end of absolute faith in markets are historical turning points .
And what happens in 2009 may jeopardize some of the positive results of 1989 , including the peaceful reunification of Europe and the triumph of democratic principles over nationalist , if not xenophobic , tendencies .
In 1989 , liberal democracy triumphed over the socialist ideology incarnated and promoted by the Soviet Bloc .
For many of his supporters , it was President Ronald Reagan who , with his deliberate escalation of the arms race , pushed the Soviet economy to the brink , thereby fully demonstrating the superiority of liberal societies and free markets .
Of course , there are obvious differences between 1989 and now .
First , and perhaps above all , the revolutions of 1989 and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union put an end to global bipolarity . By contrast , 2009 is likely to pave the way to a new form of bipolarity , but with China substituting for the Soviet Union .
Second , whereas democracy and market capitalism appeared as clear - if more fragile than expected - winners in 1989 , it is difficult in 2009 , with the spread of the global crisis , to distinguish winners from losers .
Everyone seems to be a loser , even if some are more affected than others .
Yet , history is unfair , and the US , despite its greater responsibility for today &apos;s global crisis , may emerge in better shape than most countries from the morass .
In better shape , but not alone .
As a visiting professor at Harvard and MIT , I am getting a good preview of what the world could look like when the crisis finally passes .
One senses something like the making of an American-Asian dominated universe .
From the incredible media lab at MIT to the mathematics and economics departments at Harvard , Asians - Chinese and Indians , in particular - are everywhere , like the Romans in Athens in the first century BC : Full of admiration for those from whom they were learning so much , and whom they would overcome in the coming decades .
But before this new order appears , the world may be faced with spreading disorder , if not outright chaos .
What , for example , will happen to a country as central and vulnerable as Egypt when hundred of thousands of Egyptians working in the Gulf are forced to return to their homeland as a result of the crisis in the oil-producing countries ?
When the rich get less rich , the poor get poorer .
And what about the foreign workers who have reached for the &quot; European dream &quot; and are now faced with potential explosions of xenophobia in Europe &apos;s supposedly open countries ?
The consequences of 1989 ended up being less enduring than many observers , including me , would have assumed .
We can only hope that , in the end , the consequences of 2009 similarly prove to be far less dramatic than we now - intuitively and in our historical reflexes - feel them to be .
9 / 11 in Perspective
New YORK - It was a decade ago that 19 terrorists took control of four planes , flew two into the twin towers of the World Trade Center , hit the Pentagon with a third , and crashed the fourth in a field in Pennsylvania after passengers resisted and made it impossible for the terrorists to complete their malevolent mission .
In a matter of hours , more than 3,000 innocent people , mostly Americans , but also people from 115 other countries , had their lives suddenly and violently taken from them .
September 11 , 2001 , was a terrible tragedy by any measure , but it was not a historical turning point .
It did not herald a new era of international relations in which terrorists with a global agenda prevailed , or in which such spectacular terrorist attacks became commonplace .
On the contrary , 9 / 11 has not been replicated .
Despite the attention devoted to the &quot; Global War on Terrorism , &quot; the most important developments of the last ten years have been the introduction and spread of innovative information technologies , globalization , the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and the political upheavals in the Middle East .
As for the future , it is much more likely to be defined by the United States &quot; need to put its economic house in order ; China &apos;s trajectory within and beyond its borders ; and the ability of the world &apos;s governments to cooperate on restoring economic growth , stemming the spread of nuclear weapons , and meeting energy and environmental challenges .
It is and would be wrong to make opposition to terrorism the centerpiece of what responsible governments do in the world .
Terrorists continue to be outliers with limited appeal at best .
They can destroy but not create .
It is worth noting that the people who went into the streets of Cairo and Damascus calling for change were not shouting the slogans of Al Qaeda or supporting its agenda .
Moreover , measures have been implemented to push back , successfully , against terrorists .
Intelligence assets have been redirected .
Borders have been made more secure and societies more resilient .
International cooperation has increased markedly , in part because governments that cannot agree on many things can agree on the need to cooperate in this area .
Military force has played a role as well .
Al Qaeda lost its base in Afghanistan when the Taliban government that had provided it sanctuary was ousted from power .
Osama bin-Laden was finally found and killed by US Special Forces in the suburbs of Islamabad .
Drones - unmanned aircraft that are remotely steered - have proven to be effective in killing a significant number of terrorists , including many of the most important leaders .
Weak governments can be made stronger ; governments that tolerate or support terrorism must be held accountable .
But progress is not to be confused with victory .
Terrorists and terrorism cannot be eliminated any more than we can rid the world of disease .
There will always be those who will resort to force against innocent men , women , and children in pursuit of political goals .
Indeed , terrorists are advancing in some areas .
Pakistan remains a sanctuary for Al Qaeda and some of the world &apos;s other most dangerous terrorists .
A mixture of instability , government weakness , and ideology in countries such as Yemen , Libya , Somalia , and Nigeria are providing fertile territory for terrorists to organize , train , and mount operations - much as they did in Afghanistan did a decade ago .
New groups constantly emerge from the ruins of old ones .
There is also a growing danger of homegrown terrorism .
We have seen it in Great Britain and the US .
The Internet , one of the great inventions of the modern Western world , has shown itself to be a weapon that can be used to incite and train those who wish to cause harm to that world .
The question raised in October 2003 by then US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is no less relevant today : &quot; Are we capturing , killing , or deterring and dissuading more terrorists every day than the madrassas and the radical clerics are recruiting , training , and deploying against us ? &quot; All things being equal , we probably are .
But even small terrorist successes are costly in terms of lives , money , and making open societies less so .
What is to be done ?
Alas , there is no single or silver bullet .
The establishment of a Palestinian state will not be enough for those terrorists who want to see the elimination of the Jewish state , any more than reaching a compromise over Kashmir will satisfy those Pakistan-based terrorists with bigger agendas vis-à-vis India .
Reducing unemployment is desirable , of course , but many terrorists do not come from poverty .
Helping to make societies in the Middle East and elsewhere more democratic might reduce the alienation that can lead to radicalism and worse , but this is easier said than done .
Of course , we want to continue to find ways to make ourselves less vulnerable and terrorists more so .
But what may be most important , particularly in the Arab and Islamic communities , is to end any acceptance of terrorism .
The Nigerian father who warned the US embassy in Lagos that he feared what his own son might do - before that same young man attempted to detonate a bomb aboard a flight to Detroit on Christmas Day 2009 - is an example of just this .
Only when more parents , teachers , and community leaders behave likewise will recruitment of terrorists dry up and law-enforcement authorities receive full cooperation from the populations they police .
Terrorism must lose its legitimacy among those who have historically supported or tolerated it before it will lose its potency .
A &quot; Portfolio &quot; Approach to Climate Change
The world has tried with little success to cut carbon emissions under the Kyoto Protocol .
The enormous effort expended to bring the Protocol into force nonetheless indicates how much work will be required to produce the next treaty , due to be agreed in Copenhagen in December 2009 .
Campaigners will push for tough and far-reaching policies , but strong resistance will continue from countries concerned about their economic vitality .
The new negotiations will have one advantage over the earlier efforts , because governments now understand the need for a portfolio of adaptation , mitigation , and research efforts .
New research that my colleagues and I undertook for the Copenhagen Consensus Center in Denmark explores the effectiveness of different responses to this global challenge , but it strongly supports the portfolio approach for several reasons .
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; First , we now know that adaptation will be essential , because temperatures will rise by another 0.6 ° C by 2100 even if greenhouse gas emissions are eliminated tomorrow .
We also know that the impact of climate change will not be evenly distributed across the globe .
In some areas , modestly warmer temperatures could produce higher crop yields if associated changes in precipitation patterns are not adverse and / or irrigation remains viable .
Even with 0.6 ° C warming , however , Africa and South Asia will experience almost immediate reductions in the viability of many crops and , eventually , increased vulnerability to infectious disease .
These impacts will clearly hit the planet &apos;s worst-off inhabitants hardest : The &quot; bottom billion &quot; who already bear the heaviest burden of disease , poverty , conflict and malnutrition . &amp; # 160 ;
Ensuring that adaptive capacity is expanded and exploited where it is most needed is thus a key challenge .
Long-term development may give countries more capacity to soften the impact of climate change on the environment and citizens &quot; health , but in the meantime the planet &apos;s poorest people will need help from the rich .
Our analysis investigated , for example , the merits of more targeted policies for the near term : Purchasing mosquito-resistant bed nets and oral re-hydration malaria therapy for children in the poorest nations affected by climate change .
The goal was to deal aggressively and proactively with some of the marginal health impacts of global warming .
Benefits would appear almost immediately , but would dissipate over time as economies developed .
Even as development improves conditions , however , reducing carbon emissions would become increasingly important over the longer term as the impact of climate change become more severe .
Since the effects of climate change have been observed in many areas around the world , thinking about mitigation makes sense everywhere .
But we found that mitigationalone did not meet a standard cost-benefit test .
We allowed specified annual costs of climate policy to grow in proportion with global GDP through 2100 from an initial annual benchmark of $ 18 billion .
The discounted cost of the resulting stream of fixed annual costs totaled $ 800 billion , but damages avoided by this approach amounted to a discounted value of only $ 685 billion .
The Copenhagen Consensus study also examined a portfolio option of the sort heralded by the United Nations &quot; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
We allocated $ 50 billion to research into greener technology , so that only $ 750 billion could be absorbed by the economic cost of adaptation and mitigation .
The gap between the cost of carbon-free and carbon-emitting technology fell , and the taxes designed to mitigate emissions became more effective .
As a result , the research and development program essentially paid for itself , and total discounted benefits for the $ 800 billion investment climbed to more than $ 2.1 trillion . &amp; # 160 ;
Ensuring that research and development is part of the world &apos;s climate change response portfolio would make mitigation efforts more efficient and significantly enhance their ability to reduce carbon emissions over the next century .
But these favorable net benefits reflect very conservative assumptions regarding the timing of emissions reductions and when the developing world would &quot; come onboard . &quot;
Optimizing investment in the portfolio over time would , for example , increase the discounted benefits by more than a factor of three .
Expected benefits would increase further if we included the chance that potentially higher climate sensitivities would exacerbate damages , even though doing so would require including similarly plausible lower climate sensitivities , which would push in the opposite direction .
Fighting climate change can be a sound investment , even though neither mitigation nor adaptation alone will be enough to &quot; solve &quot; the problem .
To make a real difference , especially in the near term , the world must combine mitigation and adaptation with increased research and development into carbon-saving and sequestering technology , which in turn requires designing and exploiting market-based incentives .
A &quot; Reset &quot; Button for Europe &apos;s Backyard
Stockholm - One year after the war in Georgia of last August , pushing the &quot; reset &quot; button on diplomatic relations is a popular endeavor nowadays .
President Barack Obama recently journeyed to Moscow in order to &quot; reset &quot; strained United States-Russian ties .
The European Union , though not in need of a &quot; reset &quot; because of strained ties with its eastern neighbors , is involved in a deep strategic reconstruction of those relations .
When the EU launched its new &quot; Eastern Partnership &quot; in May , the purpose was to promote further integration with the Union &apos;s six immediate eastern neighbors - Armenia , Azerbaijan , Belarus , Georgia , Moldova , and Ukraine .
The global financial crisis had made an updated and strengthened policy for the EU &apos;s eastern neighborhood an urgent need .
Equally important was the fact that all the countries concerned expressed an ambition to move closer to the EU .
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; The Eastern Partnership - originating from a Polish / Swedish initiative - offers to the six countries a substantial upgrading and deepening of relations with the EU in key areas .
In trade and economic relations , it clearly sets out the objective of establishing deep and comprehensive free-trade areas between the EU and the partner countries .
It confirms full visa liberalization as a long-term goal ( with visa facilitation agreements in the meantime ) , promises enhanced cooperation on energy security , diversification , and efficiency , and comes with dedicated programs and projects to help the neighbors in their integration and reform efforts in all these areas .
Sweden &apos;s assumption of the EU Presidency this month should help these efforts .
However , it comes at a time when the Union &apos;s eastern neighborhood faces severe challenges , with the financial and economic crisis hitting many of the partner countries hard .
Ukraine suffers from the sharp drop in global demand and trade , severely undermining its steel industry .
Georgia &apos;s economic success has been largely dependent on direct foreign investment , for which there is hardly any appetite today .
Partner countries that are less integrated into the global market , such as Moldova , have seen the crisis arrive more slowly , but the real effect might be equally as bad , and they are likely to recover more slowly .
The Eastern Partnership does not offer any quick remedies to the crisis .
But it can provide a political framework and institution-building support to improve the deficiencies that made these countries so vulnerable to the crisis : Imperfect market economies , weak state institutions , and continued corruption .
The Eastern Partnership &apos;s offer of deep integration with the EU in the areas such as trade and energy carries with it considerable transformational power .
The other type of crisis that most of the partner countries are enduring is political .
In most of these countries , democratic development has not yet reached a point where a change in government is a routine part of political life and can take place without risking the country &apos;s stability .
The Eastern Partnership is based on the profound values of democracy , human rights , and the rule of law .
Political association with the EU , and the process of integration under this Partnership , will promote reforms in these key areas .
The Swedish EU Presidency will concentrate on starting up the concrete work - the nuts and bolts - of the Partnership .
The establishment of &quot; Comprehensive Institution-Building Programs , &quot; designed to support reform of key institutions in each partner country , should take place before the year &apos;s end .
Some flagship initiatives proposed by the European Commission will finally see the light of day as well , and new projects and initiatives are likely to be developed .
Here , Sweden will attach particular importance to energy efficiency programs , which will serve not only the purposes of enhancing energy security and reducing costs , but will also be an important contribution to the fight against climate change .
The Swedish Presidency , together with the European Commission , intends to organize the first meeting of the Eastern Partnership Civil Society Forum this autumn .
We hope to see the start of parliamentary cooperation , as well as exchanges between local and regional authorities of the thirty-three EU and partner countries .
At the end of the year , a meeting of EU foreign ministers and their colleagues from the six partners will assess the progress made so far and give guidance on the way ahead .
The Eastern Partnership is about EU integration , about the six countries moving closer to the EU &apos;s values , legislation , and ways of working , and about the EU being there to support and help this convergence .
In Russia , there is a perception that is sometimes fostered which suggests that the Partnership is directed against it .
But this , of course , is untrue .
On the contrary , Russia , like Turkey , will be welcome to take part in relevant activities within the Partnership &apos;s multilateral dimensions .
The Eastern Partnership is not an answer to all the problems and difficulties that the six partners are facing .
Nevertheless , it does represent a clear commitment by the EU to lend its political and economic support to their transition and reform - a process that should bring prosperity and stability to the whole region .
A &quot; Third Way &quot; for Confronting Russia
Paris - &quot; Let &apos;s engage Russia if we can , but contain it if we must . &quot;
These two alternatives already defined Western strategy toward Russia in the mid-1990 &quot; s .
Since then , Russia may have changed dramatically , but not our questions about it .
What do you do when your big neighbor widens the gap that exists between its culture , which is European , and its political system , which is becoming increasingly &quot; Asian , &quot; at least in the bad old sense of &quot; Oriental Despotism &quot; ?
Should the best answer to the return of Russia &apos;s imperial ambitions be a modern version of a Holy Alliance of stability designed to contain the world &apos;s new maverick ?
Or is a latter-day Yalta Conference , aimed at redrawing the political boundaries of Europe , necessary ?
Could the answer be a bit of both ?
If Russia is becoming what revolutionary France was under Napoleon , or reverting to Soviet form - shorn of a totalitarian ideology but with an appetite for conquest and re-conquest - what is needed is not the &quot; league of democracies &quot; advocated by some conservatives in America .
What is needed , instead , is a &quot; stability league &quot; that includes prominent actors like China , India , and other countries that are more interested in economic growth than in &quot; rocking the boat &quot; of the international system .
Such a strategy implies , first of all , a solid partnership with China , not because it is evolving in the direction of democracy , but because it is a status-quo power .
Such a strategy could lead to the opening of negotiations with Iran , and of course to a further closing of ranks within NATO .
The message to the Kremlin here would be crystal clear .
&quot; Do not fool yourself . Nationalism and imperialism will lead you nowhere ; you cannot expand geographically without serious costs to your economic growth and your personal enrichment .
Europe may be weak and divided , America may no longer be what it was , but with your falling population and the sad state of your economy beyond oil and gas , you simply are not equipped to be in the league of great global powers . China is ; you are not . &quot;
But the containment argument fails , because the Kremlin can still make mischief around the world by acting with Syria or Venezuela in an irresponsible manner .
More importantly , rallying the world solely against Russia would mean taking Russia &apos;s great power pretensions too seriously .
For example , many Asians believe that Russia is a problem for Europe , but no longer for the world .
At the Cold War &apos;s end , Japan remained obsessed with Russia as the heir to the Soviet Union .
Today , the Japanese are so concerned with China that they have little time for fears about Russia .
The other alternative to a rebirth of &quot; containment &quot; would consist in accepting the Russian argument , or more precisely , Russian &quot; emotions . &quot;
It would mean saying , in effect , &quot; We have unnecessarily humiliated you over the last ten years .
From NATO enlargement to the grant of independence to Kosovo , we have deliberately ignored your sensitivities and your interests .
Let &apos;s sit down together like Churchill , Roosevelt , and Stalin at Yalta and redesign a twenty-first-century map of Europe .
What do you want back ?
What do we keep ? &quot;
This approach might recognize Russia &apos;s droit de regard on the future evolution of the Caucasus .
Indeed , while talking tough under the guidance of Nicolas Sarkozy &apos;s France , which currently holds the EU presidency , Europe has de facto resigned itself to Georgia &apos;s dismemberment .
Russian troops are to remain in South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
The West is not about to declare war on Russia for the sake of a Georgia whose credibility has been greatly eroded by its president &apos;s irresponsible behavior .
As for Ukraine , it may one day become part of the European Union , but its future is not in NATO .
Yet , between all-out containment , which is very unlikely and not necessarily desirable or realistic , and accommodation which borders on appeasement , which would be dangerous for Europe &apos;s future , a third way , based on a few firm principles , must be found .
These principles are clear . First , Ukraine &apos;s territorial integrity is not negotiable .
This has been said many times , but repetition does not diminish its importance .
Russia without Ukraine is a manageable nation-state ; Russia with Ukraine is an unmanageable empire .
Second , even if the West condemns Georgia &apos;s irresponsibility and incorporates into its policy Russia &apos;s sensitivities on the complex historical feelings related to its ex-imperial territories , the Kremlin &apos;s shameless brutality is unacceptable .
After all , this is Europe more than six decades after World War II , and nearly 20 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union . The use of force to settle scores and impose one nation &apos;s will upon another cannot be accepted passively .
In the short term , time may be on Russia &apos;s side .
In the long run - economically , demographically , politically , strategically - time is on &quot; our &quot; side , if we stick to our values and our principles .
A Bad Deal for America &apos;s Future
Washington , DC - The painfully negotiated US budget legislation that President Barack Obama signed on August 2 combines an increase in America &apos;s government debt ceiling with reductions in federal spending , thus averting the prospect of the first default in the 224-year history of the United States .
But the agreement has three major flaws .
Two of them offset each other , but the third threatens what America needs most in the coming years : Economic growth .
The first flaw is that the spending reductions are badly timed : Coming as they do when the US economy is weak , they risk triggering another recession .
The measure &apos;s second shortcoming , however , is that the spending reductions that it mandates are modest .
While the legislation does too little to address America &apos;s problem of chronic and rising budget deficits , the damage that it inflicts on the economy in the short term is likely to be limited .
The third and most damaging flaw , however , is that the spending cuts come in the wrong places .
Because the Democrats in Congress have an almost religious commitment to preserving , intact , America &apos;s principal welfare programs for senior citizens , Social Security and Medicare , the legislation does not touch either of them .
These programs &quot; costs will rise sharply as the 78-million-strong baby-boom generation - those born between 1946 and 1964 - retires and collects benefits , accounting for the largest increase in government spending and prospective deficits in the years ahead .
And , because the Republicans in Congress have an equally strong allergy to raising any taxes , any time , under any circumstances , the bill does not rely at all on tax increases - not even for the wealthiest Americans - for the deficit reduction that it provides .
All of the spending cuts come from the &quot; discretionary &quot; part of the federal budget , which excludes Social Security , Medicare , the Medicaid program for the poor , and interest on the national debt .
That leaves only about one-third of total federal spending from which to cut , and much of that goes to the defense budget , which Republicans will attempt to protect in the future .
So the structure established by the August 2 law concentrates deficit reduction on the &quot; discretionary non-defense &quot; part of the federal budget , which is only about 10 % of it .
This is too small a pool of money from which to achieve deficit reduction on the scale that the US will need in the years ahead .
Worse yet , discretionary non-defense spending includes programs that are indispensable for economic growth - and economic growth is indispensable for America &apos;s future prosperity and global standing .
Growth is , in the first place , the best way to reduce the country &apos;s budget deficits .
The higher the growth rate , the more revenues the government will collect without raising tax rates ; and higher revenues enable smaller deficits .
Moreover , economic growth is necessary to keep the promise - enormously important to individual Americans - that each generation will have the opportunity to become more prosperous than the preceding one , the popular term for which is &quot; the American dream . &quot;
Just as important for non-Americans , only robust economic growth can ensure that the US sustains its expansive role in the world , which supports the global economy and contributes to stability in Europe , East Asia , and the Middle East .
As Thomas L. Friedman and I explain in our forthcoming book That Used To Be Us : How America Fell Behind in the World It invented and How We Can Come Back , a crucial factor in America &apos;s economic success has been an ongoing public-private partnership , which dates back to the founding of the country , that is imperiled by the pattern of budget cuts established by the August 2 legislation .
That partnership has five components : Wider opportunities for education in order to produce a workforce with cutting-edge skills ; investment in infrastructure - roads , power plants , and ports - that supports commerce ; funds for research and development to expand the frontiers of knowledge in ways that generate new products ; an immigration policy that attracts and retains talented people from beyond America &apos;s borders ; and business regulations strong enough to prevent disasters such as the near-meltdown of the financial system in 2008 but not so stringent as to stifle the risk-taking and innovation that produce growth .
The first three elements of the American formula for growth cost money , and that money is included in the &quot; discretionary non-defense &quot; part of the federal budget now targeted by the debt-ceiling legislation .
Cutting these programs will lower American economic growth in the long term , with negative consequences both at home and abroad .
Reducing the deficit by cutting funds for education , infrastructure , and research and development is akin to trying to lose weight by cutting off three fingers . Most of the weight will remain , and one &apos;s life prospects will have worsened significantly .
Reducing deficits in order to raise the debt ceiling was the right thing to do , but the August 2 law does it in the wrong way .
Unless more deficit reduction , which is inevitable , comes from curbing entitlement benefits and increasing revenues , and less from programs vital for economic growth , the result will be a poorer , weaker US - and a more uncertain , if not unstable , world .
A Better and Safer Europe
To many , myself included , NATO &apos;s enlargement to take in , among others , the Baltic states of Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania -- which were once Soviet republics -- is an impossible dream come true .
When the idea was first floated some 10 years ago , expansion into the Baltics was taken seriously by few people .
Until recently , Russia &apos;s robust opposition to the idea posed a serious obstacle , because it sharpened the impression that Russia regarded its so-called &quot; near abroad &quot; as a zone of special interest and influence .
NATO &apos;s enlargement makes it crystal clear that no country in the new Europe can be regarded as part of another country &apos;s &quot; zone . &quot;
It assures the three small Baltic countries that the nightmare of occupation by big neighbors ( Hitler &apos;s Reich and Stalin &apos;s USSR ) , which they endured for half-a-century -- will not be repeated .
By putting paid to any revanchist tendencies in Russia concerning the Baltics , Europe is made a safer place , and Russia is helped in its effort to redefine itself as a national state and not an empire .
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; Expansion will also create a better Europe because enlargement widens the territory in which countries are committed to NATO &apos;s political values , including individual rights as well as the rights of minorities .
Fortunately Russia now seems to grasp the value of this political aspect of NATO-enlargement .
Rightly so : Enlargement of NATO is not an &quot; expansion &quot; that threatens Russia or other countries which strive for democratic political reforms .
On the contrary , expansion takes away the worries - be they real or imagined - that surround the situation of the large Russian-speaking populations that now live outside of Russia but within the borders of the former Soviet Union .
The civil rights of the Russian minorities in the Baltics and elsewhere are now enshrined in law , due in no small part to NATO demands .
Those civil rights initiatives on the part of NATO reflect the increasingly workmanlike way that Russia , Europe , and America now work out their disagreements .
Indeed , enlargement of NATO comes only a few days after a deal was struck between Russia and the EU on the tricky question of access to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad .
This small piece of Russia , with 1 million inhabitants and bordering on the Baltic Sea , is squeezed between Poland and Lithuania , two future members of the EU .
This could have incited a complicated situation where Russians were faced with tough visa requirements when travelling between Kaliningrad and Russia proper .
A deal was struck between President Putin and the EU that makes access much easier without compromising the status of Lithuania and Poland within the EU-regime .
This , in turn , created once again the kind of win-win situation that is so important for future relations between the EU and Russia .
When the enlargement of the EU into Central and Eastern Europe is finally decided by the European Council in Copenhagen next month , the conclusion is clear : Europe has become a much better and safer place to live in , thanks to the decisions taken by NATO and the EU during the crucial autumn of 2002 .
But this is no cause for complacency . For the really hard work is only now beginning : Dealing with all the internal practical and political problems that these enlargements will bring , as well as reckoning with countries in the membership waiting rooms , in particular Russia .
Relations with Russia are of vital importance if Europe is to continue to improve the quality of life of its citizens and address concerns of safety .
The common threat of international terrorism must be faced jointly .
We need to convince each other that the fight against this common enemy has to be fought with a keen eye to balancing the needs of security with those of human and minority rights .
Kaliningrad could be a litmus test of these relations .
The first hurdle has been overcome with the agreement on access to the enclave .
The next hurdle is to support Kalingrad &apos;s fight against disease and crime as well as strengthening its economic and social structures .
This calls for generosity from the EU and flexibility from Moscow .
In a wider context this could lead to a strengthening of the so-called Northern Dimension of the EU , where the goal is a free trade area to include all the countries around the Baltic Sea .
Such a grand project can be achieved if the political will exists and asserts itself .
Only a few years ago EU and NATO enlargement were regarded as wild dreams .
But determination and political will has now made the dreams come true .
Now is the time to set new ambitious goals for Europe .
A Better Way to Reduce Nuclear Risks
In 1977 , when I served in President Jimmy Carter &apos;s State Department , I was sent to India to dissuade that country &apos;s leaders from developing a nuclear bomb .
My hosts replied that they needed to keep up with China .
I said that Pakistan would inevitably follow suit and the world would become less safe .
India promised that it would not export its weapons technology .
So far as we know , its leaders have kept their word .
But revelations about the nuclear weapons smuggling network organized by A. Q. Khan , the father of Pakistan &apos;s bomb , confirm the danger I predicted back then .
Some call Khan &apos;s network an effort to spread an &quot; Islamic bomb , &quot; but given that North Korea was on the list of recipients along with Libya and Iran , it might better be termed a corrupt bomb .
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; As events in Pakistan illustrate , the spread of nuclear technology does not extend the stability that comes with mutual deterrence .
Rather , it increases the prospects of corrupt leakage that may allow terrorist groups access to nuclear weapons .
That makes everyone less safe .
Any pathological group of extremists could destroy New Delhi , Tokyo , Paris , or any city they chose .
Now the world &apos;s attention is focussed on Iran , one recipient of Pakistani technology , as the country seemingly keenest to create its own nuclear arsenal .
According to the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , Iran began enriching uranium at a pilot centrifuge plant last August , and is constructing larger underground enrichment facilities .
Iran proclaims that its programs are for peaceful generation of nuclear energy , but inspectors have already found traces of highly enriched weapons-grade uranium .
Last October , Mohamed El Baradei , the head of the IAEA , announced that Iran had accepted enhanced inspection procedures .
In addition , after visits by the French , British , and German foreign ministers , Iran announced a temporary suspension of its enrichment program .
Now it hints that it may resume enrichment , and recent press reports about the imports from Pakistan suggest Iran failed to disclose everything to the IAEA .
Iran claims that as a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty , it has the right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes .
Correct , because the NPT was born with a loophole .
Even if a country agrees to broad ranging IAEA inspections , it can legally accumulate enriched uranium ( or reprocessed plutonium ) under the guise of a peaceful energy program , and then suddenly declare that circumstances have changed and withdraw from the treaty - with the ability to produce nuclear weapons on short notice .
If Iran did this , it would not only add to the dangers in an unstable region , but would likely begin a process of unravelling the non-proliferation regime worldwide .
Iran may ask what right others have to demand that it forego nuclear weapons .
The answer lies both in the fact that it promised not to do so when it signed the NPT and in the consequences that it would impose on others .
For these reasons , President Bush declared an Iranian nuclear weapon unacceptable .
However , America &apos;s unilateral options are limited .
Not only is the US military busy trying in Iraq , but the way the US went into Iraq - which proved to have fewer nuclear capabilities than Iran - undermined American credibility , making it difficult to recruit allies to contain Iran &apos;s nuclear ambitions .
Fortunately , there is a multilateral option and an existing precedent . In the mid-1970 &apos;s , many parties to the NPT planned to import and develop enrichment and reprocessing facilities .
Realizing the threat to the non-proliferation regime , countries as diverse as the Soviet Union , France , Germany , and Japan formed a &quot; Nuclear Suppliers Group &quot; that restrained the export of enrichment and reprocessing facilities .
That plugged part of the loophole in the treaty without amending it .
Today , such countries should join together to offer Iran ( and others ) a deal .
Countries that wish to develop nuclear energy but not nuclear bombs should be given international guarantees of fuel supply and disposal of spent fuel .
For example , Russia , which is helping Iran construct a nuclear reactor at Bushehr , should offer Iran a guarantee of low enriched uranium fuel and reprocessing of the reactor &apos;s spent fuel by sending it back to Russia if Iran agrees to forego enrichment and reprocessing .
This deal could then be given teeth by the UN Security Council .
The Council would declare that further proliferation of nuclear weapons is a threat to peace , and that any country moving in that direction is subject to sanctions .
Such a resolution would also include a carrot by guaranteeing Iran access to the non-dangerous parts of the nuclear energy fuel cycle .
The pot could be further sweetened by offers to relax existing sanctions and provide a security guarantee if Iran remains non-nuclear .
European foreign ministers have already expressed their concerns about Iran &apos;s nuclear program .
Russia indicates that it is willing to provide such fuel services .
It is time for the Security Council to try to internationalize the most dangerous parts of the nuclear fuel cycle .
It is not too late to learn the lessons of the misadventures of A. Q. Khan .
A Big Chance for Small Farmers
New YORK - The G-8 &quot; s $ 20 billion initiative on smallholder agriculture , launched at the group &apos;s recent summit in L &apos;Aquila , Italy , is a potentially historic breakthrough in the fight against hunger and extreme poverty .
With serious management of the new funds , food production in Africa will soar .
Indeed , the new initiative , combined with others in health , education , and infrastructure , could be the greatest step so far toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals , the internationally agreed effort to reduce extreme poverty , disease , and hunger by half by 2015 .
During 2002-2006 , I led the United Nations Millennium Project , which aimed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals , for then-UN Secretary General Kofi Annan .
One cornerstone of the project was &quot; smallholder farmers , &quot; meaning peasant farm families in Africa , Latin America , and Asia - working farms of around one hectare ( 2.5 acres ) or less .
These are some of the poorest households in the world , and , ironically , some of the hungriest as well , despite being food producers .
They are hungry because they lack the ability to buy high-yield seeds , fertilizer , irrigation equipment , and other tools needed to increase productivity .
As a result , their output is meager and insufficient for their subsistence .
Their poverty causes low farm productivity , and low farm productivity reinforces their poverty .
It &apos;s a vicious circle , technically known as a poverty trap .
The UN Millennium Project &apos;s Hunger Task Force , led by two world-leading scientists , M. S. Swaminathan and Pedro Sanchez , examined how to break this vicious circle .
The Hunger Task Force determined that Africa could substantially increase its food production if help was given to smallholder farmers , in the form of agricultural inputs . The Millennium Project recommended a big increase in global funding for this purpose . Drawing on that work and related scientific findings , Annan launched a call in 2004 for an African Green Revolution , based on an expanded partnership between Africa and donor countries .
Many of us , notably current UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon , have worked hard to make this possible , with Ban repeatedly emphasizing the special emergency arising from the global food , financial , and energy crises of the past two years .
The G-8 announcement reflects these years of effort , and of course the boost from the leadership of US President Barack Obama , Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Zapatero , Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd , World Bank President Robert Zoellick , European Commissioner Louis Michel , European Parliamentarian Thijs Berman , and others .
Now the key is to make this effort work .
The lessons of history are clear .
Getting seed and fertilizer to smallholder farmers at highly subsidized prices ( or even free in some cases ) will make a lasting difference .
Not only will food yields rise in the short term , but farm households will use their higher incomes and better health to accumulate all sorts of assets : Cash balances , soil nutrients , farm animals , and their children &apos;s health and education .
That boost in assets will , in turn , enable local credit markets , such as micro-finance , to begin operating .
Farmers will be able to buy inputs , either out of their own cash , or by borrowing against their improved creditworthiness .
A consensus has now been reached on the need to assist smallholders , but obstacles remain .
Perhaps the main risk is that the &quot; aid bureaucracies &quot; now trip over each other to try to get their hands on the $ 20 billion , so that much of it gets taken up by meetings , expert consultations , overhead , reports , and further meetings .
&quot; Partnerships &quot; of donors can become an expensive end in themselves , merely delaying real action .
If donor governments really want results , they should take the money out of the hands of thirty or more separate aid bureaucracies and pool it in one or two places , the most logical being the World Bank in Washington and the International Fund for Agricultural Development ( IFAD ) in Rome .
One or both of these agencies would then have an account with several billion dollars .
Governments in hunger-stricken regions , especially Africa , would then submit national action plans that would provide details on how they would use the donor funds to get high-yield seeds , fertilizer , irrigation , farm tools , storage silos , and local advice to impoverished farmers .
An independent expert panel would review the national plans to verify their scientific and managerial coherence .
Assuming that a plan passes muster , the money to support it would quickly be disbursed .
Afterward , each national program would be monitored , audited , and evaluated .
This approach is straightforward , efficient , accountable , and scientifically sound .
Two major recent success stories in aid have used this approach : The Global Alliance on Vaccines and immunizations , which successfully gets immunizations to young children , and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , TB , and Malaria , which supports national action plans to battle these killer diseases .
Both have saved millions of lives during the past decade , and have paved the way to a new more efficient and scientifically sound method of development assistance .
Not surprisingly , many UN agencies and aid agencies in rich countries fight this approach .
All too often , the fight is about turf , rather than about the most effective way to speed help to the poor .
Obama , Rudd , Zapatero , and other forward-thinking leaders can therefore make a huge difference by following up on their pledges at the G-8 and insisting that the aid really works .
The bureaucracies must be bypassed to get help to where it is needed : In the soil tilled by the world &apos;s poorest farm families .
A Black and White Question
New YORK - In the afternoon of July 16 two men appeared to be breaking into a fine house in an expensive area of Cambridge , Massachusetts .
Alerted by a telephone call , a policeman arrived smartly on the scene .
He saw one black male standing inside the house and asked him to come out .
The man refused .
He was then told to identify himself .
The man , still refusing to step out , said he was a Harvard professor , showed his ID , and warned the cop not to mess with him .
He said something about black men in America being singled out , and asked the cop , who was white , for his name and identification .
The cop , joined by several colleagues , arrested the professor for disorderly conduct .
We now know that the professor had broken into his own home , with the help of his chauffeur , because the door was jammed .
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; What was unusual here was not the cop &apos;s heavy-handedness .
Most people in the US know that if you talk back to the police , they will get nasty very fast .
The fact that the man was black might or might not have made the cop go for his handcuffs even sooner than he might normally have done .
That , too , would not have been unusual .
What made this case special was that Henry Louis &quot; Skip &quot; Gates is one of the most celebrated professors in the country , famous for his books , his articles , and numerous television appearances .
He is a grandee , a mover and shaker in the academic and media world , a friend of President Barack Obama .
That is why he warned the cop , Sgt. James Crowley , a veteran of the Cambridge police force , not to mess with him .
Class and race overlap in the US .
In this instance , it is impossible to PRY them apart .
Gates , deeply conscious , indeed a specialist of the terrible history of race relations in his country , instinctively assumed that he was a victim of prejudice .
From his words it appears that he was equally conscious of not getting the proper respect due to a distinguished Harvard professor and media celebrity .
As he put it to his daughter in an interview published online : &quot; &#91; Crowley &#93; should have gotten out of there and said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , sir , good luck .
Loved your &#91; television &#93; series - check with you later ! &quot; &quot;
Alas , Sgt.Crowley had never heard of Professor Gates .
A local man whose brothers all serve in the police force , a sports fan , and an amateur basketball coach , Crowley does not move in the same social circles as Gates .
As it happens , the charges were duly dropped , and there the case might have rested if President Obama , tired and frustrated after weeks of fighting for his healthcare bill , had not weighed in on behalf of his &quot; friend &quot; Gates , and called the police &quot; stupid . &quot;
Both he and Gates then spoke of &quot; learning &quot; from the incident .
Gates might even be planning a television documentary on racial profiling .
One thing to be learned , if we didn &apos;t know this already , is how close racial sensitivities are to the surface of US life , despite the election of a black president .
The complexities of black anger , white guilt , and of black , and white fear , are so vexed that most Americans prefer not to talk about race at all .
The field is too full of mines .
One of Obama &apos;s great achievements is that he made it into a serious topic through the brilliance and subtlety of his rhetoric .
And there remains plenty to talk about : The grotesquely disproportionate number of black men in US prisons ; the lack of educational opportunities in poor , mostly black areas ; the appalling healthcare system ; and the very real brutality used by police officers against blacks , who don &apos;t have the privilege of a Harvard ID .
It is probably true that many white policemen , even if they are trained to avoid racial profiling , as Sgt. Crowley was , need to be convinced that a black man can be at home in one of the finer houses of Cambridge , or any other American city .
But is the Gates affair the right way to enter into this discussion ?
One might argue that itwas .
If not Professor Gates , then who ?
Precisely because he is a grandee , he is in the position to draw national attention to a serious issue .
If the same thing had happened to an unknown man in Harlem , or some other poor , or predominantly black district , no one would ever have heard about it .
The fact that it happened to a professor in Cambridge makes everyone sit up and take notice .
There is , however , a danger that it will have an adverse affect on the necessary national discussion about race .
By having made such a big issue out of what was in fact a relatively minor event Gates could be accused of trivializing much worse instances of abuse .
Indeed , we don &apos;t even know for certain whether this was such an instance .
Crowley never mentioned the color of Gates &quot; skin .
There was no question of violence .
There were just very raw nerves and hypersensitivity to hints of disrespect , on the part of the professor , and of the cop .
Outrage about a professor who is not to be messed with is not the best way to discuss the plight of countless , poor , anonymous people , whom most of us find it too easy to ignore .
A Bomb in Every Reactor
Berlin - Twenty-five years after the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl , the ongoing catastrophe at the Fukushima nuclear reactor in Japan has - it must be hoped - made clear once and for all that the purported blessings of the nuclear age are mere Illusions : Nuclear power is neither clean nor safe nor cheap .
Indeed , the opposite is true .
Nuclear power is saddled with three major unresolved risks : Plant safety , nuclear waste , and , most menacing of all , the risk of military proliferation .
Moreover , the alternatives to nuclear energy - and to fossil fuels - are well known and technically much more advanced and sustainable .
Taking on nuclear risk is not a necessity ; it is a deliberate political choice .
Fossil-fuel and nuclear energy belong to the technological utopias of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries , which were based on a belief in the innocence of the technologically feasible and on the fact that , at the time , only a minority of people worldwide , largely in the West , benefited from technological progress .
By contrast , the twenty-first century will be informed by the realization that the global ecosystem and its resources , which are indispensable for human survival , are finite , and that this implies an enduring responsibility to preserve what we have .
Meeting this imperative entails both an enormous technological challenge and an opportunity to redefine the meaning of modernity .
The energy future of nine billion people , which is what the world population will be in the middle of the century , lies neither in fossil fuels nor in nuclear energy , but in renewable energy sources and dramatic improvements in energy efficiency .
We already know this .
Why , then , do the most advanced countries , in particular , take on the risk of a mega-catastrophe by seeking to create energy from radioactive fission ?
The answer , ultimately , doesn &apos;t lie with any civilian use of nuclear energy , but first and foremost with its military applications .
The energy derived from splitting uranium and plutonium atoms was originally used for the ultimate weapon , the atomic bomb .
Being a nuclear power provides sovereign states with protection and prestige .
Even today , the Bomb divides the world into two classes : The few states have it , and the many that do not .
The old Cold War world order was based on the nuclear arms race between the two superpowers , the United States and Soviet Union .
To stop others from trying to become nuclear powers , which would have multiplied and spread the risk of nuclear confrontation , the Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) was framed in the 1960 &quot; s .
To this day , it governs the relationships between the nuclear powers and the rest of the world , imposing renunciation on the have-nots and nuclear-disarmament obligations on the haves .
Of course , the NPT has repeatedly been violated or circumvented by states that never subscribed to it .
To this day , therefore , the risk remains that the number of nuclear powers will increase , particularly given small and medium powers &quot; hope to enhance their prestige and position in regional conflicts .
Iran is the most current example of this .
The nuclearization of these not-always-stable states threatens to make the regional conflicts of the twenty-first century much more dangerous , and will also substantially increase the risk that nuclear weapons eventually end up in the hands of terrorists .
Despite the NPT , a clear separation between civilian and military use of nuclear energy hasn &apos;t always worked , or worked completely , because the NPT &apos;s rules permit all signatory states to develop and use - under international supervision - all of the components of the nuclear fuel cycle for civilian purposes .
From here , then , all that is required to become a nuclear power are a few small technical steps and political leaders &quot; decision to take them .
This political power , not the requirements of energy policy , is what makes giving up nuclear energy so difficult .
As a rule , the path to nuclear-power status always begins with so-called &quot; civilian &quot; nuclear programs .
The supposed &quot; civilian &quot; nuclear ambitions of Iran have thus , for instance , led to a large number of such &quot; civilian &quot; programs in neighboring states .
Honni soit qui mal y pense !
And , of course , the reactions of the nuclear powers to the disaster at Fukushima will be watched and analyzed closely by the so-called &quot; clandestine threshold countries . &quot;
So how will the world - first and foremost , the main nuclear powers - react to the Fukushima disaster ?
Will the tide truly turn , propelling the world towards nuclear disarmament and a future free of nuclear weapons ?
Or will we witness attempts to downplay the calamity and return to business as usual as soon as possible ?
Fukushima has presented the world with a far-reaching , fundamental choice .
It was Japan , the high-tech country par excellence ( not the latter-day Soviet Union ) that proved unable to take adequate precautions to avert disaster in four reactor blocks .
What , then , will a future risk assessment look like if significantly less organized and developed countries begin - with the active assistance of the nuclear powers - to acquire civilian nuclear-energy capabilities ?
Any decision to continue as before would send an unambiguous message to the clandestine threshold countries that are secretly pursuing nuclear weapons : Despite lofty rhetoric and wordy documents , the nuclear powers lack the political will to change course .
Were they to abandon nuclear energy , however , their epochal change of heart would constitute a seminal contribution to global nuclear security - and thus to the fight against nuclear proliferation .
A Born-Again CAP
Wageningen , NETHERLANDS - Born in 1957 , the Common Agricultural Policy ( CAP ) is now more than 50 years old , and the European Commission is proposing what it calls a health check for its middle-aged child .
But superficial repairs will not meet the European Union &apos;s future needs .
The CAP must be born again .
Work on its renewal is due to start now , with the completed project ready in 2013 .
But a much more profound re-think is needed .
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; The CAP &apos;s original aim was to provide a secure source of food for the six original member states of the Union , which were importers of food and sought a degree of self-sufficiency .
Good , healthy , and cheap food had to be accessible for all citizens .
Improved agricultural productivity would benefit rural areas and give farmers a comparative share in the Union &apos;s growing wealth .
Instruments to achieve those objectives were developed , and food security was achieved .
The CAP quickly came to be seen as the jewel in the crown of the European project .
As the EU has evolved and expanded , food systems have become more complex , involving production , processing , supply-chain organization , and wholesale and retail distribution , with all of these involving new issues like health and the environment .
The use of land is also receiving more serious scrutiny .
A 1991 study by the Netherlands Scientific Council for Governmental Policy , entitledGround for Choices , demonstrated that the EU &apos;s food supply could be met with 50 % less cultivated land , 80 % less pesticides , and at 50 % less cost .
Pollution would be reduced by 70 % as a result of fewer nitrates in the surface water , and greenhouse gases would be cut .
Those figures were for an EU of 15 countries , so with today &apos;s 27 members the possibilities are even greater .
A Dutch analysis of land use has shown that by employing the best technical and ecological means on the best available land , substantial gains could be made in food production .
So it is not surprising that the number of farmers needed has fallen substantially .
Viewed from the standpoint of food security and the wealth of rural areas , there is now an urgent need to revisit the CAP &apos;s main instruments so that a new policy formula can be introduced .
Perverse subsidies must be removed and recent new ones favoring products such as bio-fuels reconsidered .
Thestatus quo clearly has to be changed .
Rural policy in the EU is too often reduced to income guarantees for the farming community .
But that attitude is undermining change .
Competition must be encouraged , as more rural entrepreneurship will strengthen the farming community , with fewer farmers but better farms .
A simplified CAP would encourage cleaner , more productive , and efficient agriculture .
A side benefit for the EU &apos;s standing in the world could be that the World Trade Organization &apos;s stalled Doha negotiations could be restarted once farmers in developing countries are assured of getting a fair deal from Europe .
Moreover , the CAP &apos;s role as a motor of political and social integration in Europe could be restored once renewed policies are in place .
But renewal of this sort cannot be left to global market forces , as the results might not necessarily benefit European agriculture and society .
If the market &quot; misbehaves , &quot; farmers could be reduced to poverty , leading to the neglect of large areas of Europe .
That is a real enough danger to which policymakers must give serious thought as they reform the CAP on the basis of the following five pillars .
1 . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; The EU needs a knowledge and innovation policy that strengthens European agriculture &apos;s competitiveness .
Such a policy has been successful in the Netherlands , substantially contributing to the development and power of the country &apos;s agribusiness .
Ten of 21 branches of Dutch agribusiness , including horticultural seeds , ornamentals , seed potatoes , and veal , are among the top contributors to the national economy and the country &apos;s trade balance .
In the EU as a whole , a policy directed toward research programs stimulating scientific excellence and greater coherence in the European knowledge system would greatly strengthen agriculture &apos;s competitiveness and contribute to food security and sustainable development .
2 . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; Europe also needs a restructuring policy for land use .
Many structural improvement programs have been financed at the European level , but agricultural production and land use are not among them .
The development of an Agricultural Main Structure would compliment the European Ecological Main Structure .
Reforestation and the repair of natural ecosystems should also be part of a land use policy .
3 . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; A policy for European food systems would treat production , processing , distribution , logistics , and retailing in combination .
Consumption patterns and preferences are an integral part of such systems .
Preliminary studies by the European Science Foundation &apos;s &quot; Forward Look on European Food Systems &quot; could prove useful in devising an EU-wide policy .
4 . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; Metropolitan agriculture in a rapidly urbanizing world can provide high-quality produce on small amounts of land .
It offers an answer to rising demand for healthy food with minimal environmental side effects .
5 . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; A new CAP should include a policy to safeguard Europe &apos;s landscapes .
But a cultural heritage should not be maintained everywhere , nor should it ignore cost .
And it should not be a defensive policy of the sort that tends to concentrate on poor-quality land .
These five pillars involve drastic choices , but they will probably require less money from Europe &apos;s taxpayers , not more .
They could make a real contribution to cleaner , more productive , and efficient farming and land use , while addressing social needs .
A boycott Against Reason
&quot; It could happen here &quot; is the shorthand phrase frequently used for a variety of alarming hypothetical scenarios .
&quot; How could this happen here ? &quot; Was the question more pertinently asked in Great Britain recently , as its universities witnessed the unfolding of an all-too-real and perplexing action .
In early June , the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education ( NATFHE ) , Britain &apos;s largest academic union , with 67,000 members , passed a motion to sever ties with all Israeli professors and institutions of higher learning unless they publicly dissociate themselves from &quot; continuing Israeli apartheid policies . &quot;
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; The motion was subsequently revoked ; but the fact that it was put forward at all is astonishing enough .
Indeed , the union &apos;s call for a wholesale boycott contravened its most fundamental values : The principle of academic freedom , openness , and exchange ; protection of research from state politics ; and the fundamental right to free speech .
The motion implicitly adopted the yardstick of collective punishment and a distinctly McCarthyite tone , demanding a sort of &quot; disloyalty oath &quot; from Israeli academics .
What led scholars who are putatively the guardians of democratic freedoms to embrace measures so reminiscent of fascist and Stalinist tactics ?
Unfortunately , the NATFHE effort is part of a larger phenomenon .
In 2005 , the Association of University Teachers ( AUT ) called for a more limited boycott , singling out Bar Ilan and Haifa Universities for opprobrium .
Before that , a petition , signed by roughly 80 prominent British intellectuals and a few from other European countries , demanded the cessation of European Union funding for Israeli cultural projects and institutions .
These campaigns , encouraged by Palestinian groups and non-governmental organizations , have been accompanied by individual acts of professional ostracism , and an informal boycott of Israeli scholars , publications , and cultural projects already exists in some European circles .
Such developments suggest an advanced and deeply disturbing trend , whereby certain segments of the European intelligentsia are willing to violate their own beliefs in order to target one state for unique stigmatization ; and whereby insidious and sometimes illegal forms of discrimination against that state &apos;s citizens are increasingly seen as acceptable .
In a certain ideological mind-set , Israel is perceived not as a political entity , susceptible to prevailing standards of judgment , but as an almost allegorical force , the symbolic center and source of the globe &apos;s evils and ailments .
Of course , Israel has been guilty of both bad policies and political sins .
The occupation of Palestinian territories has had terrible consequences , and it is necessary to end it .
But in today &apos;s intensely charged climate , the Middle East has become a kind of ideological projection screen , a magnet for tendencies to demonization and idealization .
In the putatively &quot; radical &quot; interpretation , the relationship between Israel and the Palestinians is rarely seen as a conflict between two groups with sometimes tragically opposed interests .
Rather , the stubborn complexities of the situation are reduced to a stark struggle between absolute power and absolute powerlessness , the archetypal oppressor and archetypal oppressed .
The rhetoric applied to Israel becomes ever more extreme , and conducive to hatred .
Phrases like &quot; apartheid state &quot; and &quot; Zionism is racism , &quot; unthinkable in liberal discourse a few years ago , have become routine .
At the same time , the Palestinians become objects of romanticized identifications - one of the leaders of the NAFTHE motion was seen , prior to a meeting , draped in a Palestinian flag - and unwitting condescension .
They are seen as the last pure cause , the entirely innocent &quot; Other , &quot; unimplicated in their fate and apparently deprived of political agency or choice .
The possibility that the Palestinians are capable of deliberate decisions , that they have adopted policies which may have contributed to the current situation , or that they have exercised their own forms of power and violence , is , in this framework , never admitted .
Hamas was never mentioned in either of the university unions &quot; motions .
This is Manicheanism of the left , and , like Manicheanism of the political right , it can distort reality to the point of becoming divorced from it .
Certainly , the boycott efforts ignored basic facts .
Unless British academics are ill informed , they know that Israel , far from being an &quot; apartheid state , &quot; has a large proportion of Arab citizens ; that Israeli universities are well integrated , in some cases with considerable numbers of Arab students , as well as a number - admittedly small and insufficiently representative - of Arab faculty ; that many universities sponsor collaborative projects with Palestinian and Arab colleagues ; that they are often sites of dissidence against government policies ; and that such dissidence , even in radical forms , is tolerated .
Advocates of discriminatory measures often charge their opponents with stifling legitimate criticism of Israel .
This argument is both disingenuous and dishonest .
Many of the boycotts &quot; critics are also critical of Israel .
But credible criticism must be based on evidence - and on generally applicable criteria of judgment .
If the British unions wanted to be ethically consistent , they should apply the same strategies to universities in the numerous countries where human rights are brutally abused and free speech suppressed .
Some see this hostility to Israel as camouflaging old-fashioned anti-Semitism .
It is always risky to speculate about hidden motives ; nevertheless , systematic disparagement of Israeli society and culture undoubtedly encourages the sense that anti-Semitism , too , is a permitted prejudice .
It is always easier to see a group or nation as a malevolent &quot; Other &quot; when this impulse is fed by an old , and still potent , prejudice .
There is a deeper issue at stake .
Democratic societies depend not only on the foundational principle of free speech , but on the character of political thought and conversation among various constituencies .
When the supposedly most enlightened and liberal of those constituencies resorts to illiberal discourse and intolerant measures , tendencies toward bigotry and ideological irrationality are reinforced .
The actions of the British academic unions have Israel as their obvious target .
But their main effect may be an erosion of reasoned debate and civil conduct , without which democracy is powerless against the forces of polarization and extremism .
A Breakthrough Against Hunger
New YORK - Today &apos;s world hunger crisis is unprecedentedly severe and requires urgent measures .
Nearly one billion people are trapped in chronic hunger - perhaps 100 million more than two years ago .
Spain is taking global leadership in combating hunger by inviting world leaders to Madrid in late January to move beyond words to action .
With Spain &apos;s leadership and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon &apos;s partnership , several donor governments are proposing to pool their financial resources so that the world &apos;s poorest farmers can grow more food and escape the poverty trap .
The benefits of some donor help can be remarkable .
Peasant farmers in Africa , Haiti , and other impoverished regions currently plant their crops without the benefit of high-yield seed varieties and fertilizers .
The result is a grain yield ( for example , maize ) that is roughly one-third less than what could be achieved with better farm inputs .
African farmers produce roughly one ton of grain per hectare , compared with more than four tons per hectare in China , where farmers use fertilizers heavily .
African farmers know that they need fertilizer ; they just can &apos;t afford it . With donor help , they can .
Not only do these farmers then feed their families , but they also can begin to earn market income and to save for the future .
By building up savings over a few years , the farmers eventually become creditworthy , or have enough cash to purchase vitally necessary inputs on their own .
There is now widespread agreement on the need for increased donor financing for small farmers ( those with two hectares or less of land , or impoverished pastoralists ) , which is especially urgent in Africa .
The UN Secretary General led a steering group last year that determined that African agriculture needs around $ 8 billion per year in donor financing - roughly four times the current total - with a heavy emphasis on improved seeds , fertilizer , irrigation systems , and extension training .
In addition to direct help for small farms , donors should provide more help for the research and development needed to identify new high-yielding seed varieties , especially to breed plants that can withstand temporary flooding , excess nitrogen , salty soils , crop pests , and other challenges to sustainable food production .
Helping the poor with today &apos;s technologies , while investing in future improved technologies , is the optimum division of labor .
This investment pays off wonderfully , with research centers such as the International Rice Research Institute and the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre providing the high-yield seeds and innovative farming strategies that together triggered the Asian Green Revolution .
These centers are not household names , but they deserve to be .
Their scientific breakthroughs have helped to feed the world , and we &apos;ll need more of them .
Dozens of low-income , food-deficit countries , perhaps as many as 40-50 , have elaborated urgent programs for increased food production by small farms , but are currently held back by the lack of donor funding .
These countries have appealed to the World Bank for financing , and the Bank made a valiant effort in 2008 to help through its new Global Food Crisis Response Program ( GFCRP ) .
But the Bank does not yet have sufficient funds to meet these countries &quot; urgent needs , and has had to ration assistance to a small fraction of the flows that could be effectively and reliably used .
Hundreds of millions of people , in the meantime , remain trapped in hunger .
Many individual donor countries have declared that they are now prepared to increase their financial support for smallholder agriculture , but are searching for the appropriate mechanisms to do so .
The current aid structures are inadequate .
The more than 20 bilateral and multilateral donor agencies for agriculture are highly fragmented and of insufficient scale individually and collectively .
Despite the dedicated efforts of many professionals , the response to the hunger crisis remains utterly inadequate .
The 2008 planting seasons came and went with much too little additional help for impoverished small farmers .
African countries search endlessly , and mostly fruitlessly , for the small amounts of funding needed for their purchases of fertilizer and improved seeds .
My colleagues and I , serving on an advisory committee for the Spanish initiative , have recommended that donors pool their funds into a single international account , which we call the Financial Coordination Mechanism ( FCM ) .
These pooled funds would enable farmers in poor countries to obtain the fertilizer , improved seed varieties , and small-scale irrigation equipment that they urgently need .
Poor countries would receive prompt and predictable financing for agricultural inputs from a single account , rather than from dozens of distinct and fragmented donors .
By pooling financial resources into a single-donor FCM , aid programs &quot; administrative costs could be kept low , the availability of aid flows could be assured , and poor countries would not have to negotiate 25 times in order to receive help .
The time for business as usual is over .
The donors promised to double aid to Africa by 2010 , but are still far off track .
Indeed , during the past 20 years , they actually cut aid for agriculture programs , and only now are reversing course .
Meanwhile , a billion people go hungry each day .
We need a breakthrough that is demonstrable , public , clear , and convincing , that can mobilize the public &apos;s hearts and minds , and that can demonstrate success .
History can be made in Madrid at the end of January , when the world &apos;s richest and poorest countries converge to seek solutions to the global hunger crisis .
The lives of the billion poorest people depend on it .
A Breakthrough Opportunity for Global Health
New YORK - Every year , millions of people die from preventable and treatable diseases , especially in poor countries .
In many cases , lifesaving medicines can be cheaply mass-produced , but are sold at prices that block access to those who need them .
And many die simply because there are no cures or vaccines , because so little of the world &apos;s valuable research talent and limited resources is devoted to addressing the diseases of the poor .
This state of affairs represents a failure of economics and law that urgently needs to be corrected .
The good news is that there are now opportunities for change , most promisingly through an international effort headed by the World Health Organization that would begin to fix the broken intellectual-property regime that is holding back the development and availability of cheap drugs .
Two main problems limit the availability of medicines today .
One is that they are very costly ; or , more accurately , the price charged for them is very high , though the cost of producing them is but a fraction of that amount .
Second , drug development is geared toward maximizing profit , not social benefit , which skews efforts directed at the creation of medicines that are essential to human welfare .
Because the poor have so little money to spend , drug companies , under current arrangements , have little incentive to do research on the diseases that afflict them .
It doesn &apos;t have to be this way .
Drug companies argue that high prices are necessary to fund research and development .
But , in the United States , it is actually the government that finances most health-related research and development - directly , through public support ( National Institutes of Health , National Science Foundation ) , and indirectly , through public purchases of medicine , both in the Medicare and Medicaid programs .
Even the part that is not government-financed is not a conventional market ; most individuals &quot; purchases of prescription medicines are covered by insurance .
Government finances health-care research because improved medicines are a public good .
The resulting knowledge benefits everyone by stopping epidemics and limiting the economic and human toll of widespread illness .
Efficiency requires sharing research as widely as possible as soon as it is available .
Thomas Jefferson compared knowledge to candles : When one is used to light another , it does not diminish the light of the first .
On the contrary , everything becomes brighter .
Yet , in America and most of the world , drug prices are still exorbitant and the spread of knowledge is tightly limited .
That is because we have created a patent system that gives innovators a temporary monopoly over what they create , which encourages them to Hoard their knowledge , lest they help a competitor .
While this system does provide incentives for certain kinds of research by making innovation profitable , it allows drug companies to drive up prices , and the incentives do not necessarily correspond to social returns .
In the health-care sector , it may be more profitable to devote research to a &quot; me-too &quot; drug than to the development of a treatment that really makes a difference .
The patent system may even have adverse effects on innovation , because , while the most important input into any research is prior ideas , the patent system encourages secrecy .
A solution to both high prices and misdirected research is to replace the current model with a government-supported prize fund .
With a prize system , innovators are rewarded for new knowledge , but they do not retain a monopoly on its use .
That way , the power of competitive markets can ensure that , once a drug is developed , it is made available at the lowest possible price - not at an inflated monopoly price .
Fortunately , some US lawmakers are taking a strong interest in this approach .
The Prize Fund for HIV / AIDS Act , a congressional bill introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders , is just such an initiative .
His bill also contains an important provision aimed at encouraging open-source research , which would move the current research model away from secrecy toward sharing .
But , globally , our innovation system needs much bigger changes .
The WHO &apos;s efforts to encourage broad reforms at the international level are crucial .
This spring , the WHO released a report that recommends solutions similar to those proposed in the US Senate bill , but on a global level .
Importantly , the report , &quot; Research and Development to Meet Health Needs in Developing Countries , &quot; recommends a comprehensive approach , including mandatory funding contributions from governments for research on developing countries &quot; health needs ; international coordination of health-care priorities and implementation ; and a global observatory that would monitor where needs are greatest .
In late May , the international community will have a chance to begin implementing these ideas at the WHO World Health Assembly - a moment of hope for public health around the world .
Reforming our innovation system is not just a matter of economics .
It is , in many cases , a matter of life and death .
It is therefore essential to de-link R &amp; amp ; D incentives from drug prices , and to promote greater sharing of scientific knowledge .
For America , the Sanders bill marks important progress .
For the world , the WHO &apos;s recommendations represent a once-in-a-generation opportunity to remedy a long-standing and egregious inequity in health care , and , more broadly , to set a model for governance of global public goods befitting an era of globalization .
We cannot afford to let this opportunity pass us by .
A Centerless Euro Cannot Hold
Cambridge - With youth unemployment touching 50 % in eurozone countries such as Spain and Greece , is a generation being sacrificed for the sake of a single currency that encompasses too diverse a group of countries to be sustainable ?
If so , does enlarging the euro &apos;s membership really serve Europe &apos;s apparent goal of maximizing economic integration without necessarily achieving full political union ?
The good news is that economic research does have a few things to say about whether Europe should have a single currency .
The bad news is that it has become increasingly clear that , at least for large countries , currency areas will be highly unstable unless they follow national borders .
At a minimum , currency unions require a confederation with far more centralized power over taxation and other policies than European leaders envision for the eurozone .
What of Nobel Prize winner Robert Mundell &apos;s famous 1961 conjecture that national and currency borders need not significantly overlap ?
In his provocative American Economic Review paper &quot; A Theory of Optimum Currency Areas , &quot; Mundell argued that as long as workers could move within a currency region to where the jobs were , the region could afford to forgo the equilibrating mechanism of exchange-rate adjustment .
He credited another ( future ) Nobel Prize winner , James Meade , for having recognized the importance of labor mobility in earlier work , but criticized Meade for interpreting the idea too stringently , especially in the context of Europe &apos;s nascent integration .
Mundell did not emphasize financial crises , but presumably labor mobility is more important today than ever .
Not surprisingly , workers are leaving the eurozone &apos;s crisis countries , but not necessarily for its stronger northern region .
Instead , Portuguese workers are fleeing to booming former colonies such as Brazil and Macau .
Irish workers are leaving in droves to Canada , Australia , and the United States .
Spanish workers are streaming into Romania , which until recently had been a major source of agricultural labor in Spain .
Still , if intra-eurozone mobility were anything like Mundell &apos;s ideal , today we would not be seeing 25 % unemployment in Spain while Germany &apos;s unemployment rate is below 7 % .
Later writers came to recognize that there are other essential criteria for a successful currency union , which are difficult to achieve without deep political integration .
Peter Kenen argued in the late 1960 &quot; s that without exchange-rate movements as a shock absorber , a currency union requires fiscal transfers as a way to share risk .
For a normal country , the national income-tax system constitutes a huge automatic stabilizer across regions .
In the US , when oil prices go up , incomes in Texas and Montana rise , which means that these states then contribute more tax revenue to the federal budget , thereby helping out the rest of the country .
Europe , of course , has no significant centralized tax authority , so this key automatic stabilizer is essentially absent .
Some European academics tried to argue that there was no need for US-like fiscal transfers , because any desired degree of risk sharing can , in theory , be achieved through financial markets .
This claim was hugely misguided .
Financial markets can be fragile , and they provide little capacity for sharing risk related to labor income , which constitutes the largest part of income in any advanced economy .
Kenen was mainly concerned with short-term transfers to smooth out cyclical bumpiness .
But , in a currency union with huge differences in income and development levels , the short term can stretch out for a very long time .
Many Germans today rightly feel that any system of fiscal transfers will morph into a permanent feeding tube , much the way that northern Italy has been propping up southern Italy for the last century .
Indeed , more than 20 years on , Western Germans still see no end in sight for the bills from German unification .
Later , Maurice Obstfeld pointed out that , in addition to fiscal transfers , a currency union needs clearly defined rules for the lender of last resort .
Otherwise , bank runs and debt panics will be rampant .
Obstfeld had in mind a bailout mechanism for banks , but it is now abundantly clear that one also needs a lender of last resort and a bankruptcy mechanism for states and municipalities .
A logical corollary of the criteria set forth by Kenen and Obstfeld , and even of Mundell &apos;s labor-mobility criterion , is that currency unions cannot survive without political legitimacy , most likely involving region-wide popular elections .
Europe &apos;s leaders cannot carry out large transfers across countries indefinitely without a coherent European political framework .
European policymakers today often complain that , were it not for the US financial crisis , the eurozone would be doing just fine .
Perhaps they are right .
But any financial system must be able to withstand shocks , including big ones .
Europe may never be an &quot; optimum &quot; currency area by any standard .
But , without further profound political and economic integration - which may not end up including all current eurozone members - the euro may not make it even to the end of this decade .
The Global Economy &apos;s New Path
Washington , DC - Whether we like it or not , the world around us is in a state of constant change .
But recent economic trends suggest that this change may be shifting its direction in a fundamental way .
Consider the advanced economies .
During the last two decades , economic growth in these countries was led by consumption - so much so that economic activity in these economies swung from investment to consumption by a total of 10 percentage points of GDP .
As a result , in 2010 the share of consumption in their GDP had reached 81.6 % .

Meanwhile , emerging markets and developing economies provided almost a mirror image of this trend , raising their investment and boosting the supply of goods to the rest of the world at the cost of consumption in their own economies .
By 2010 , the share of consumption in their GDP had declined , from 73.4 % to 67.1 % .
Looking forward , it is unlikely that the consumption share of GDP can increase further in advanced economies .
The main drivers of this increase were primarily financial engineering and wealth effects from strong asset prices .
Neither of these factors currently is at play to push consumption &apos;s share of GDP higher .
But can the advanced economies &quot; consumption even be sustained at the current level ?
Perhaps not .
Current levels of consumption are associated with over-extended governments and households , whose debt levels remain high , implying that more savings are required .
Banks also need to raise capital .
In general , many economic agents need an extended period of deleveraging .
However , current policies in the major advanced economies are aimed at maintaining current consumption levels in order to support growth and employment .
If the consumption share of GDP nonetheless declines , simple arithmetic tells us that investment and exports need to be higher to maintain total demand .
Should we expect emerging markets and developing economies to pick up the slack ?
To sustain strong growth in these economies as external demand weakens , domestic demand needs to become the major engine of growth .
This means stronger domestic consumption and appropriate levels of investment to support such consumption growth .
In economies where investment levels are leading to excess capacity , resources could shift from investment to consumption , provided that these countries &quot; external accounts remain sustainable .
These are major tectonic shifts in the structure of the global economy , and are fraught with potential dangers .
The pace of change will vary between sectors and across economies , leading to mismatches of demand and supply worldwide .
Moreover , with globalization , an economic problem in one part of the world can be transmitted to the rest of the world more strongly , substantially complicating policy responses in both advanced and developing economies .
A study of such spillover effects by the International Monetary Fund suggests that , before the global financial crisis , external factors explained 36 % of change in output in the five systemically important economies ( the eurozone , the United States , China , Japan , and the United Kingdom ) ; after the crisis , however , this share reached close to 60 % .
In the rest of the world , including emerging markets , the share of external factors in output change increased from about 43 % to more than 60 % .
In this environment , we must diligently pursue policy coordination at the global level .
To achieve an orderly realignment of consumption and investment worldwide , policies that boost investment in one part of the world should match policies that boost consumption in other parts .
In particular , advanced economies should implement fundamental productivity-enhancing reforms , the eurozone should strengthen the currency union , and emerging market and developing economies should boost their domestic sources of growth .
And these policies should be consistent with fiscal and external stability .
Moreover , financial-sector policies and regulatory frameworks should be coordinated at the global level , in order to design and implement consensus-based rules - thereby addressing the problems posed by very large , global institutions that are considered too big or too complex to fail .
Only with such global coordination can we reduce , and possibly eliminate , economic instability and disorderly adjustments both at home and abroad , even as we seek to maximize the benefits of the inevitable changes in the global economy .
A Chinese Champion of Peace and Freedom
Prague - On Christmas Day last year , one of China &apos;s best-known human rights activists , the writer and university professor Liu Xiaobo , was condemned to 11 years in prison .
Liu is one of the main drafters of Charter 08 , a petition inspired by Czechoslovakia &apos;s Charter 77 , calling on the Chinese government to adhere to its own laws and constitution , and demanding the open election of public officials , freedom of religion and expression , and the abolition of &quot; subversion &quot; laws .
For his bravery and clarity of thought about China &apos;s future , Liu deserves the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize .
There are two reasons why we believe that Liu would be a worthy recipient of that prestigious award .
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; First and foremost , he stands in the tradition of Nobel Peace Prize laureates who have been recognized for their contribution to the struggle for human rights .
Nobel laureates such as Martin Luther King , Lech Walesa , and Aung San Suu Kyi are but a few of the many examples that the Nobel Committee has recognized in previous years .
We are convinced that the concepts that Liu and his colleagues put down on paper in December 2008 are both universal and timeless .
These ideals - respect for human rights and human dignity , and the responsibility of citizens to ensure that their governments respect those rights - represent humanity &apos;s highest aspirations .
Should the Nobel Committee choose to recognize Liu &apos;s courage and sacrifice in articulating these ideals , it would not only draw global attention to the injustice of Liu &apos;s 11-year sentence . It would also help to amplify within China the universal and humanistic values for which Liu has spent so much of his life fighting .
The second reason why Liu deserves the Nobel Peace Prize resonates with Alfred Nobel &apos;s original intent for the award .
In working to promote human rights , political reform , and democratization in China , Liu has made a significant contribution to the values of peace and fraternity among nations that Nobel had in mind when he created the award more than a century ago .
Of course , democratization does not automatically guarantee better behavior on the world stage . But it does facilitate a full and rigorous public debate over key questions of a state &apos;s foreign and domestic policies .
This active and searching conversation , the hallmark of a democratic polity , is the best hope for better decisions by governments , both at home and abroad .
Liu &apos;s committed advocacy on behalf of democracy in China is , above all , intended for the benefit of the Chinese people .
But his courage and example may help to accelerate the dawn of the day when China &apos;s participation in international affairs is aided by the expertise and oversight of civil-society groups , an independent media , and an engaged citizenry able to express its views through the ballot box .
It is primarily for these two reasons that we believe that Liu would be a worthy recipient of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize .
In conferring on Liu one of the world &apos;s highest honors , the Committee would be signaling once again the importance of human rights and democracy on the one hand , and world peace and international solidarity on the other .
Liu &apos;s harsh prison sentence was meant as an exemplary measure , a stern warning to all other Chinese who might want to follow his path .
We are convinced that there are moments when exemplary civic engagement , such as Liu &apos;s , requires an exemplary response .
Awarding him the Nobel Peace Prize is precisely the response that his courage deserves .
A Clarion Call for Emerging Markets
Ithaca - With 2012 underway , it is worth reflecting on how a decade of strong economic growth in emerging markets led to last year &apos;s resounding political transformations .
From the dramatic events in the Middle East , to the groundswell of support for the anti-corruption crusader Anna Hazare in India , leaders in emerging markets are getting a clear message from the streets that growth is not everything .
They ignore this message at their peril .
Emerging-market economies delivered solid growth during the 2000 &quot; s , and even survived the global financial crisis without a growth collapse .
But the specter of rising corruption is compromising the legitimacy of their economic gains and eroding support for further reforms needed to sustain their growth momentum .
Corruption takes many forms , but , in emerging markets , a combination of factors has turned it into a cancer that ultimately topples regimes .
Relentless low-level corruption is a major irritant for poor people in many of these countries ; indeed , it limits their access to the social services and basic government functions that they often depend upon for their very survival .
Another type of corruption involves siphoning enormous sums of money from large-scale projects .
In India , for example , the government lost as much as $ 30-40 billion of much-needed revenue when coveted band spectrum was sold through a rigged auction .
For ordinary people , large-scale corruption is less visible , because , while the sums involved are mind-boggling , the costs are not as directly felt as they are in the case of lower-level graft .
But the perception of this type of mega-corruption has changed as rapid growth has increased inequality .
In countries like China and India , rapid economic growth has lifted a huge number of people out of poverty .
But the fruits of globalization and rapid growth have not been evenly shared - the rich become super-rich , even as a large fraction of the population remains destitute .
Rising income inequality is hardly limited to emerging markets , but their combination of open corruption and pervasive inequities creates a toxic brew that is undermining support for reforms that would strengthen and consolidate their economic gains .
In many emerging markets , a lack of political freedom adds to the combustible mix .
The combination of corruption , inequality , and political repression builds up enormous pressure , and there are no institutional channels through which to release it .
But freer political regimes are not a panacea .
In a democracy like India &apos;s , the politically well-connected benefit from skewed growth , thus increasing the resentment of those left behind .
The opportunity to &quot; throw the rascals out &quot; in each election cycle helps to let off some steam , but it does not resolve the problems that are generating it .
It is difficult to predict what triggers popular protest , but economic factors are key .
For example , rising food prices tend to hurt the poor , especially the urban poor , who spend a large share of their income on food ; unlike agricultural workers , they receive none of the benefits of higher food prices .
With swelling urban populations , it will become increasingly difficult to keep a lid on these pressures .
Some governments have reacted to recent events with political repression , information blackouts , or a combination of authoritarian measures .
China , for example , blocked media coverage of the Egyptian protests .
The Arab Spring , however , reveals the fragility of repressive political regimes that try to maintain their legitimacy by limiting information flows .
The main lesson for dynamic emerging-market countries is that an exclusive focus on GDP growth may ultimately not be good for economic and political stability .
Even with rapid increases in national income , if these countries &quot; leaders do not distribute the benefits fairly , they will become vulnerable to popular discontent .
Tackling corruption is critical to improving long-term growth and maintaining social stability .
These economies need measures that help to keep the poor out of poverty traps , and that give them realistic opportunities to improve their economic well-being .
Such steps include broadening financial markets to give more people access to credit and investment , strengthening social safety nets to protect the economically vulnerable , and improving educational access and quality .
These lessons apply equally to advanced economies , which also suffer from rising inequality and subtle forms of corruption .
But , for those wealthy economies , restoring decent growth is now the major priority .
Emerging markets have a golden opportunity to build on their economic gains and lock in growth and stability by tackling deep-seated problems like corruption .
As the past year &apos;s events have shown , the costs of inaction could be calamitous .
A Clockwork Chemistry
Oxford - In Anthony Burgess &apos;s Novella ( and Stanley Kubrick &apos;s film ) A Clockwork Orange , Alex , an unrepentant psychopath , has his eyes pried wide open and is forced to watch violent images .
Like Pavlov &apos;s dog , Alex is being programmed to respond with nausea to violence and sex .
This scene remains shocking , but , like most science fiction , it has aged .
The behaviorist psychology it drew upon has long expired , and the fear that science will be used to make , or even force , people to be morally better now sounds old-fashioned .
Science fiction ages fast , but it has a long afterlife .
Over the past decade , an army of psychologists , neuroscientists , and evolutionary biologists has been busy trying to uncover the neural &quot; clockwork &quot; that underlies human morality .
They have started to trace the evolutionary origins of pro-social sentiments such as empathy , and have begun to uncover the genes that dispose some individuals to senseless violence and others to acts of altruism , and the pathways in our brain that shape our ethical decisions .
And to understand how something works is also to begin to see ways to modify and even control it .
Indeed , scientists have not only identified some of the brain pathways that shape our ethical decisions , but also chemical substances that modulate this neural activity .
A recent study has shown that the anti-depressant citalopram can change the responses of individuals to hypothetical moral dilemma scenarios .
Individuals given the drug were less willing to sacrifice an individual to save the lives of several others .
Another series of studies has shown that when the hormone oxytocin is administered via nasal spray , it increases trusting and cooperative behavior within social groups , but also decreases cooperation with those perceived as outsiders .
Neuroscientists have even magnetically &quot; zapped &quot; carefully targeted areas of people &apos;s brains to influence their moral judgments in surprising ways - for example , making it easier for them to lie .
Of course , no one is developing a &quot; moral pill &quot; that will transform us into saints .
But the research is advancing fast , and it is almost certain to suggest new ways to reshape our moral intuitions , sentiments , and motivations .
Should we use our growing scientific understanding of the basis of human morality to try to make people morally better ?
A Clockwork Orange was accused of glorifying violence , and some of its scenes are still hard to watch .
But as Burgess himself argued , the Novella has an almost Christian message : What makes us human is our freedom to choose both good and evil , and for society to crush individuals into servile conformity is as Wicked as , and perhaps even worse than , the sadism of psychopaths like Alex .
I suspect that many will agree with this view . They will agree that our ability to distinguish right from wrong is something precious that we should safeguard , not a broken clock that scientists should fix .
Of course , most of us don &apos;t need to be conditioned to feel repulsed by rape or torture .
But this does not mean that we are morally good , or good enough .
As you read this , perfectly ordinary people somewhere in the world are doing unspeakable things to others .
Even in the most advanced and affluent societies , a vast concentrated effort is needed to preserve even minimal decency : Think of locks , security alarms , police , courts , and prisons .
And it is doubtful that we really care enough about others , or give enough to the less fortunate .
Humans are born with the capacity to be moral , but it is a limited capacity which is ill equipped to deal with the ethical complexities of the modern world .
For thousands of years , humans have relied on education , persuasion , social institutions , and the threat of real ( or supernatural ) punishment to make people behave decently .
We could all be morally better , but it is clear that this traditional approach cannot take us much further .
It is not as if people would suddenly begin to behave better if we just gave them more facts and statistics , or better arguments .
So we shouldn &apos;t be too quick to dismiss the suggestion that science might help - in the first instance , by helping us design more effective institutions , more inspiring moral education , or more persuasive ethical arguments .
But science might also offer more direct ways of influencing our brains .
Science fiction sometimes limits rather than expands our sense of what is possible .
It would be self-defeating , or worse , to try to promote morality through brutal coercion .
Governments must not be given the power to control its citizens &quot; moral code - we know that if they had such power , they would misuse it .
It would be ideal if individuals could freely explore different ways to improve themselves , whether by practicing mindfulness , reading moral philosophy , or , yes , by taking a &quot; morality &quot; pill .
But it is also true that although some people are eager to take pills that make them feel better or think faster , it is not so obvious that people would really want to take pills that would make them morally better . It is not clear that people really want to be morally better .
And those who , like the Psychopathic Alex , need the most help are probably those who would want it least .
These are , of course , hypothetical questions .
We don &apos;t yet know what is possible .
But it is better to begin the ethical discussion too early than too late .
And even if &quot; moral pills &quot; are just science fiction , they raise deep questions .
Will we want to take them if they ever become available ?
And what does it say about us if we won &apos;t ?
A Cloud over Airplane Safety
Princeton - When airports across Europe reopened after the closure caused by the eruption of Iceland &apos;s Eyjafjallajökull volcano , it was not because the amount of ash in the atmosphere had dropped , but because the risk that the ash posed to airplane safety had been reassessed .
Was it new scientific information that led to the lifting of the flight ban , or was it a reflection of the hardship , both personal and economic , that the ban was causing ?
Over six days , about 95,000 flights were canceled , at a cost to airlines of more than $ 1 billion .
An estimated five million people were stranded or delayed .
The British economy lost £ 1.5 billion , and others were similarly affected .
Flower growers in Kenya , who depend on air transport to take their short-lived product to Europe , suddenly had no income .
Sixteen cancer patients in critical need of bone marrow for transplants were put at risk because the matching marrow could not be flown in from the United States or Canada .
In the past , jets flying into ash from volcanoes in the US , Indonesia , the Philippines , and Mexico have temporarily lost engine power , and in one case , dropped thousands of feet , although all managed to land safely .
But there was no evidence that the more widely dispersed ash blowing over Europe from Iceland would cause similar problems .
The decision to ground flights was based on the view that any level of ash in the atmosphere posed some risk to aircraft , and that no matter how slight that risk might be , the government &apos;s job was , as British Prime Minister Gordon Brown put it , &quot; to make sure that safety was paramount . &quot;
Indeed , in closing their skies , European governments seem to have given safety absolute priority over everything else .
Yet none of them act on that principle in other areas .
Some 3,000 people die on the world &apos;s roads every day .
Cutting speed limits to , say , 10 kilometers per hour would prevent most accidents and save many lives .
We don &apos;t do it , because we give safety a lower priority than our desire to spend less time driving .
The price we are willing to pay for safety cannot be infinite .
It is distasteful to put a price on human life , but the more we spend on safety , the less we will have for our other goals .
The British government uses a figure of a little more than £ 1 million as a general limit to the amount it is prepared to pay to save a statistical life - for example , by improving road safety .
In the US , the Department of Transportation is prepared to go up to $ 5.8 million - nearly four times as much , at current exchange rates - for the same purpose .
Does that mean that safety is paramount in the US , but not in Britain ?
Giovanni Bisignani , the head of the International Air Transport Association , an industry group , criticized the shutdown , saying that no risk assessment had been undertaken .
On the whole , though , the public seemed to support the decision .
Stranded travelers , interviewed at airports , typically said that they would rather be stuck at an airport than in a plane falling out of the sky .
But what if some travelers have a higher tolerance of risk , or just a more urgent need to travel , than others ?
John Stuart Mill , in his classic book On Liberty , considered a situation in which a man sets out to cross a bridge that we know is unsafe .
In Mill &apos;s view , we are justified in stopping him only to make sure that he is aware of the danger .
Once he knows of it , the decision is his to make , because only he can judge the importance of his journey , and balance that against the risk he is running .
Air safety is slightly different , because a crashing plane can kill people on the ground , but the greatest risks by far are borne by the passengers and crew .
If they are fully informed of the risks , and are still willing to fly - perhaps the crew has been offered more money , as workers in dangerous occupations often are - should we prevent them from making the decision to fly ?
In the end , after test flights with no passengers aboard had shown no engine damage , and aircraft engine manufacturers told aviation authorities that their engines could operate safely with a low level of ash in the atmosphere , Europe &apos;s skies were reopened .
The International Civil Aviation Authority has announced that it will convene a group of experts to help it provide guidance for the industry to decide what level of ash in the atmosphere makes it unsafe to fly .
Now that we have seen the costs of giving absolute priority to safety , we know that this is not only a technical question .
I trust that among the experts will be some who have pondered the underlying ethical question : How safe should we aim to be ?
A Communist Party without Communism
Princeton - Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s anointment of Alexander Medvedev to succeed him in what is supposed to be a democratic presidential election next March shows that Russia &apos;s leaders have not changed a whit .
It looks increasingly likely that , as under Leonid Brezhnev , we will see the same names in the news for decades to come .
According to Gleb Pavlovsky , the Putin regime &apos;s leading ideologist , the current Russian system is perfect in all respects but one : It doesn &apos;t know its enemies .
Indeed , it seems as if everyone in the Kremlin is reading Carl Schmitt , the Nazi legal theorist who taught that naming your enemy is the central mission of politics .
In the spirit of Schmitt , Putin &apos;s men designated a liberal party , the Union of Right Forces , as their ur-enemy . Its public meetings were broken up by armed police ; its leaders arrested and beaten ; Putin called its supporters &quot; coyotes . &quot;
What is surprising is that this aggressive behavior occurred in response to no visible danger .
Oil prices are soaring , as are Putin &apos;s approval ratings .
His appointees control everything that matters , from Gazprom to the Central Electoral Committee .
Since the pacification of Chechnya with violence and subsidies , the incarceration or emigration of a few financially viable opponents , and the massive &quot; social investments &quot; of recent years , which , under Medvedev &apos;s personal supervision , have bribed the population , no credible force can seriously challenge Putin &apos;s men .
Yet their regime is in crisis , and they know it .
Russia &apos;s economy is more dependent on gas and oil than ever before .
Military reform has been reversed .
Despite increasing incomes , Russians are less educated and less healthy than they were when Putin came to power ; they still die at a shockingly young age .
Russian involvement in world affairs is tainted by poison and corruption .
State monopolies undo what private businesses created .
With more money , ill-educated bureaucrats hire more ill-educated bureaucrats ; as a result , the regime fails to rule the country .
The country is unruly , and its rulers know it .
So they panic .
Putin &apos;s aim was to subject all power to the control of Russia &apos;s security forces .
His generation of KGB officers watched the collapse of the Communist Party and all the governmental bodies that it &quot; directed and controlled , &quot; including the KGB .
Under Putin , the security service has had its revenge .
Its people have become powerful , arrogant , and enormously rich . They have also become disobedient .
In 2004 , General Viktor Cherkesov , then Putin &apos;s representative in northwest Russia , published an essay that glorified the KGB as the only unspoiled authority in a corrupted country .
This essay , more than anything else , defined Putin &apos;s second term .
In October 2007 , Cherkesov ( now chief of one of the most obscure and powerful services , the Federal Anti-Drug Administration ) published another essay in which he lamented his colleagues &quot; degradation : Warriors had turned into traders , he complained .
Earlier , generals from a competing service , the fsb , had arrested Cherkesov &apos;s deputy for &quot; illegal bugging . &quot;
In a public gesture of despair , Cherkesov admitted the failure of Putin &apos;s project to reanimate Russian governance by subordinating it to the security services .
Cherkesov &apos;s deputy remains in prison .
Most believe that Putin is unable to intervene in his defense .
In the absence of Communist Party control , these security officers betrayed their corporate ethic and engaged in horse-trading , applying force when a trade did not go well .
That this happens to ordinary Russians is clear ; what Cherkesov revealed was that Putin &apos;s circle also confronts this situation .
What is to be done when ex-KGB warriors turn their swords and bugs against one another ?
Cherkesov &apos;s case exemplifies Putin &apos;s nightmare .
But if your instincts betray you , you go back to even deeper ones .
Now that Putin &apos;s people have left their predecessors &quot; neo-liberal ideas behind and feel disenchanted with the ex-KGB clique , the task is to recreate an omnipresent political party that controls the security services , the administration , business , and much else .
This party will be centralized under personal leadership and will reduce the state to a legal fiction .
Preaching nationalism , its managers will believe in their universal competence , as opposed to KGB-style professionalism and corporatism .
Boris Yeltsin forbade party cells in state-controlled institutions by decree .
Putin &apos;s lawyers will reverse that decision ; the party will have cells or committees in every factory , corporation , military unit , university department , etc . Integrated by the leader &apos;s charisma and party discipline , party members will direct and unify the desolated country .
This is Putin &apos;s plan .
Like former Soviet leader Yuri Andropov , the only other KGB man to rule Russia , Putin will become the party &apos;s general secretary .
As in the Soviet era , state and governmental officials will be reduced to party ciphers - the role that President Medvedev will play under General Secretary Putin .
And , of course , being General Secretary carries no constitutional term limit .
In the end , Putin has what history left him : Not ideas , just a faction yearning to consolidate its grip on power .
Lenin and Trotsky needed a party to make their ideology a reality ; Putin and Medvedev are devising an ideology to solidify their party .
It is a bizarre ideology .
Accusing warriors of being traders and traders of being thieves , it shuns its Marxist origins .
It will subordinate all who really do work - traders , warriors , journalists , and others - to party ideologues whose sole job is to search for enemies .
A Confederation for Kosovo
Time is running out in Kosovo .
If a United Nations-backed settlement is not reached by early December , the province &apos;s majority Albanian population is likely to declare independence unilaterally - a move that the United States has announced it may support .
That would be a disastrous step .
Russia would be furious , because it fears that Kosovo &apos;s secession - whether or not it is internationally recognized - might fuel separatist movements in the former Soviet empire .
Serbia is even more strongly opposed .
Dusan Prorokovic , Serbia &apos;s state secretary for Kosovo , has said that his country might use force to maintain its sovereignty .
Even if the government hesitates , ultranationalist groups might push Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica to send in troops : The current UN presence in Kosovo is very thin ( only 40 &quot; military observers &quot; and 2,116 policemen ) but the stationing of 15,000 NATO troops could make any armed clash very dangerous .
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; After eight years of international administration , Kosovo &apos;s Albanian majority has tasted freedom and is eager for full independence .
But Serbia claims that the province remains an essential part of its historical and cultural tradition .
Moreover , independence would not be accepted by the Serbian public , which has already watched in dismay as &quot; Great Serbia &quot; has been gradually whittled away , most recently with the secession of Montenegro .
Serbia is prepared to concede only &quot; enhanced autonomy &quot; to Kosovo , and some capacity to enter into international agreements .
Yet , while the two parties now seem irreconcilable , it is not too late for compromise .
But this is possible only by resuscitating - and updating - an old institution of the international community : A confederation of states .
By means of a binding UN Security Council resolution , Kosovo could be granted full and exclusive authority over its citizens and territory , as well as limited capacity for action on the international scene .
It could be authorized to enter into trade agreements as well as agreements concerning individuals ( for example , admission and circulation of foreigners , or extradition ) , plus the right to seek admission to the UN ( which does not require full sovereignty and independence ) .
Kosovo would thus gain some essential trappings of statehood .
However , a decision-making body consisting of delegates from Kosovo , Serbia , and the European Union would be given full authority over major foreign policy issues ( for example , alliances and relations with international economic institutions ) , defence , borders ( in case Kosovo wished to join with Albania ) , and the treatment of Kosovo &apos;s Serbian minority .
As a result , Kosovo and Serbia would constitute two distinct international subjects , bound by a confederation hinging on a common decision-making body .
Of course , this confederation would be asymmetrical , because the Serbian government &apos;s sovereignty over the rest of Serbia would remain intact and unlimited , whereas the Kosovar government &apos;s &quot; sovereignty &quot; over Kosovo would be restrained .
To avoid one of the two parties getting the upper hand and imposing arbitrary decisions , the common decision-making body should consist of four Serbian delegates , two Kosovar delegates , and three representatives of the EU , thus requiring both sides to gain the support of the European delegates .
In addition , the EU should create a small but effective military force ( say , 5,000 troops ) to back up the common body &apos;s decisions .
As with any compromise , the contending parties would both gain and lose from this arrangement .
Serbia would save face , and would continue to have a say on crucial matters concerning Kosovo , including the treatment of the Serbian minority .
Kosovo would acquire limited independence , with its status rising from a province of a sovereign state to an international subject capable of entering into certain agreements with other states and even joining the UN .
The EU would benefit as well , by contributing to the stabilization of a highly volatile area .
Subsequently , the EU would monitor Kosovo and prevent any dispute that might turn violent .
A final advantage of this solution is that it would be temporary .
Historically , confederations sooner or later either become federations ( as occurred in the US , Germany , and Switzerland ) or , pushed by centrifugal forces , split up ( as with the United Arab Republic , established in 1958 , which split three years later into Egypt and Syria ) .
The confederation I advocate would thus constitute an intermediate stage ( lasting five or ten years ) , at the end of which Kosovo is likely to become fully independent .
Delaying a final solution in this way would provide time to verify Kosovo &apos;s prospects of joining the EU and thus eventually sharing &quot; sovereign authority &quot; with other independent states , which could deflate Kosovars &quot; dangerously robust nationalistic demands .
A conspiracy So Immense
New YORK - Is this the Age of the conspiracy Theory ?
Plenty of evidence suggests that we are in something of a golden age for citizen speculation , documentation , and inference that takes shape - usually on the Internet - and spreads virally around the globe .
In the process , conspiracy theories are pulled from the margins of public discourse , where they were generally consigned in the past , and sometimes into the very heart of politics .
I learned this by accident .
Having written a book about the hijacking of executive power in the United States in the Bush years , I found myself , in researching new developments , stumbling upon conversations online that embrace narratives of behind-the-scenes manipulation .
There are some major themes .
A frequent one in the US is that global elites are plotting - via the Bilderberg Group and the Council on Foreign Relations , among others - to establish a &quot; One World Government &quot; dominated by themselves rather than national governments .
Sometimes , more folkloric details come into play , broadening the members of this cabal to include the Illuminati , the Freemasons , Rhodes Scholars , or , as always , the Jews .
The hallmarks of this narrative are familiar to anyone who has studied the transmission of certain story categories in times of crisis .
In literary terms , this conspiracy theory closely resembles The Protocols of the Elders of Zion , featuring secretive global elite with great power and Wicked aims .
Historically , there tends to be the same set of themes : Fearsome , uncontrolled transformative change led by educated , urbanized cosmopolitans .
Students of Weimar Germany know that sudden dislocations and shocks - rapid urbanization , disruption of traditional family and social ties , loosening of sexual restrictions , and economic collapse - primed many Germans to become receptive to simplistic theories that seemed to address their confusion and offer a larger meaning to their suffering .
Similarly , the &quot; 9 / 11 Truth Movement &quot; asserts that al-Qaeda &apos;s attack on the Twin Towers was an &quot; inside job . &quot;
In the Muslim world , there is a widespread conspiracy theory that the Israelis were behind those attacks , and that all Jews who worked in the buildings stayed home that day .
Usually , conspiracy theories surface where people are poorly educated and a rigorous independent press is lacking .
So why are such theories gaining adherents in the US and other affluent democracies nowadays ?
Today &apos;s explosion of conspiracy theories has been stoked by the same conditions that drove their acceptance in the past : Rapid social change and profound economic uncertainty .
A clearly designated &quot; enemy &quot; with an unmistakable &quot; plan &quot; is psychologically more comforting than the chaotic evolution of social norms and the workings - or failures - of unfettered capitalism .
And , while conspiracy theories are often patently irrational , the questions they address are often healthy , even if the answers are frequently unsourced or just plain wrong .
In seeking answers , these citizens are reacting rationally to irrational realities .
Many citizens believe , rightly , that their mass media are failing to investigate and document abuses .
Newspapers in most advanced countries are struggling or folding , and investigative reporting is often the first thing they cut .
Concentration of media ownership and control further fuels popular mistrust , setting the stage for citizen investigation to enter the vacuum .
Likewise , in an age when corporate lobbyists have a free hand in shaping - if not drafting - public policies , many people believe , again rightly , that their elected officials no longer represent them . Hence their impulse to believe in unseen forces .
Finally , even rational people have become more receptive to certain conspiracy theories because , in the last eight years , we actually have seen some sophisticated conspiracies .
The Bush administration conspired to lead Americans and others into an illegal war , using fabricated evidence to do so .
Is it any wonder , then , that so many rational people are trying to make sense of a political reality that really has become unusually opaque ?
When even the 9 / 11 commissioners renounce their own conclusions ( because they were based on evidence derived from torture ) , is it surprising that many want a second investigation ?
Frequently enough , it is citizens digging at the margins of the discourse - pursuing such theories - who report on news that the mainstream media ignores .
For example , it took a &quot; conspiracy theorist , &quot; Alex Jones , to turn up documentation of microwave technologies to be used by police forces on US citizens . The New Yorker confirmed the story much later - without crediting the original source .
The mainstream media &apos;s tendency to avoid checking out or reporting what is actually newsworthy in Internet conspiracy theories partly reflects class bias .
Conspiracy theories are seen as vulgar and lowbrow .
So even good , critical questions or well-sourced data unearthed by citizen investigators tend to be regarded as radioactive to highly educated formal journalists .
The real problem with this frantic conspiracy theorizing is that it leaves citizens emotionally agitated but without a solid ground of evidence upon which to base their worldview , and without constructive directions in which to turn their emotions .
This is why so many threads of discussion turn from potentially interesting citizen speculation to hate speech and paranoia .
In a fevered environment , without good editorial validation or tools for sourcing , citizens can be preyed upon and whipped up by demagogues , as we saw in recent weeks at Sarah Palin &apos;s rallies after Internet theories painted Barack Obama as a terrorist or in league with terrorists .
We need to change the flow of information in the Internet age .
Citizens should be able more easily to leak information , pitch stories , and send leads to mainstream investigative reporters .
They should organize new online entities in which they pay a fee for direct investigative reporting , unmediated by corporate pressures .
And citizen investigators should be trained in basic journalism : Finding good data , confirming stories with two independent sources , using quotes responsibly , and eschewing anonymity - that is , standing by their own bylines , as conventional reporters do .
This is how citizens can be taken - and take themselves - seriously as documenters and investigators of our common situation .
In a time of official lies , healthy investigative energy should shed light , not just generate heat .
A Constitutional Coup in Ukraine
Changing constitutions is always a risky business .
But it is a downright dangerous one when undertaken to benefit one man alone .
Indeed , when a president volunteers to reduce the powers of his own office , you can be certain that he is up to no good .
That is exactly what is going on in Ukraine , where President Leonid Kuchma proposes to junk our presidential system and replace it with a strange type of parliamentary system he has concocted .
Kuchma has not suddenly converted to the view that parliamentary democracies are better than presidential ones .
No , Kuchma wants to change Ukraine &apos;s constitution for no other reason than to maintain his grip on power .
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; Today , Kuchma rules as an all-powerful president .
But his term ends next year and he cannot run again .
So , instead of retiring gracefully , as presidents from Bill Clinton to Boris Yeltsin routinely do , Kuchma wants to change the constitution in order to become an all-powerful prime minister who will never face a limit on the length of his term .
Of course , constitutions are not meant to protect the status quo if the status quo is rotten .
Constitutions can , and should , accommodate reform when necessary .
A powerful president , however , is not necessarily wrong for Ukraine . In our wrenching postcommunist transition , it is essential that a government can act decisively .
To change a system that seems best suited to Ukraine &apos;s circumstances , you need a good reason .
The Ukraine president is authorized to appoint and sack the prime minister , dissolve parliament if he wishes , and rule by decree if he judges that the country &apos;s institutions are in danger .
He maintains day-to-day control over every aspect of government .
Sopuissant a Caesar must be above reproach .
Kuchma is not .
On the contrary , what is rotten in Ukraine is not its constitution , but its president , who is mired in charges of corruption and orchestrating the murder of journalists , and who is shunned by other world leaders .
As president , Kuchma is grotesquely unpopular .
Even Slobodan Milosevic had more support in Yugoslavia before his fall .
So Kuchma knows that he cannot rely on handpicking his successor , as Yeltsin did in Russia .
Unable to assure himself of a tame presidential successor , Kuchma wants what he calls a &quot; parliamentary republic &quot; with a weak president and powerful prime minister .
But the parliament he has in mind is a mutant , one where the authoritarian rule of the criminal clans Kuchma controls will continue , unabated , behind the facade of parliamentary procedure .
People too easily forget Ukraine , this big country on the border of the soon-to-be enlarged European Union .
But any attempt to prolong Kuchma &apos;s rule will create such a political mess that it is not absurd to fear that Ukraine could follow Belarus and the Balkans of the early 1990 &apos;s into outright dictatorship and chaos .
Indeed , this scenario could worsen , because Russia is unlikely to sit around idly and watch Ukraine unravel .
Intervention of some type seems more likely in such circumstances .
Only an imperial Russia , however , would dare reabsorb Ukraine .
But an imperial Russia cannot be a democratic Russia . So Kuchma endangers freedom and human rights not only in Ukraine , but ultimately threatens Russia &apos;s democracy as well .
Luckily , there has never been a better time for the West--particularly the EU--to nudge Ukraine back from the brink .
With EU expansion coming next spring , all Ukrainians fear that a new wall will cut their country off from the Union &apos;s easternmost border in Poland .
Although the job of maintaining Ukraine &apos;s democracy is primarily one for Ukrainians , the EU can help if it takes practical steps to reassure Ukrainians that they won &apos;t be cut off from the rest of Europe .
A generous visa regime and the use of regional development funds in Ukraine that will benefit impoverished eastern Poland , are two possible inducements .
But these should be made conditional on Kuchma leaving the country &apos;s constitution and democracy alone .
The EU should not fret about interfering in Ukraine &apos;s domestic affairs .
After all , it hesitated little a few years ago to put a current member state , Austria , on notice that it was watching out for the welfare of that country &apos;s democracy .
The wayward Kuchma is far more deserving of Europe imposing safeguards to ensure his good behavior .
Similarly , the US should cast a wary eye at Kuchma &apos;s decision to send troops to Iraq .
It cannot be the case that America &apos;s fidelity to democracy in Ukraine can be so cynically purchased .
Within Ukraine , a government capable of truly governing should seek to adopt EU laws and norms in exactly the manner that the countries poised to join the Union have done , thus helping to clean up the murky system in which Kuchma &apos;s criminal cronies flourish .
The constitution must be reformed , but not to shift power from one unaccountable leader to another .
What is needed are clear checks on arbitrary rule , and transparency in decision-making .
No one should doubt that Kuchma intends to stay in power , no matter what .
Less certain is whether he will feel secure enough to hold a presidential election ( or any other kind of election ) if he cannot change the constitution in a way that guarantees his continued misrule .
It is , after all , President Kuchma who is discredited , not Ukraine &apos;s constitutional arrangements .
A Contagion of Bad Ideas
New YORK - The Great recession of 2008 has morphed into the North Atlantic recession : It is mainly Europe and the United States , not the major emerging markets , that have become mired in slow growth and high unemployment .
And it is Europe and America that are marching , alone and together , to the denouement of a grand debacle .
A busted bubble led to a massive Keynesian stimulus that averted a much deeper recession , but that also fueled substantial budget deficits .
The response - massive spending cuts - ensures that unacceptably high levels of unemployment ( a vast waste of resources and an oversupply of suffering ) will continue , possibly for years .
The European Union has finally committed itself to helping its financially distressed members .
It had no choice : With financial turmoil threatening to spread from small countries like Greece and Ireland to large ones like Italy and Spain , the euro &apos;s very survival was in growing jeopardy .
Europe &apos;s leaders recognized that distressed countries &quot; debts would become unmanageable unless their economies could grow , and that growth could not be achieved without assistance .
But , even as Europe &apos;s leaders promised that help was on the way , they doubled down on the belief that non-crisis countries must cut spending .
The resulting austerity will hinder Europe &apos;s growth , and thus that of its most distressed economies : After all , nothing would help Greece more than robust growth in its trading partners .
And low growth will hurt tax revenues , undermining the proclaimed goal of fiscal consolidation .
The discussions before the crisis illustrated how little had been done to repair economic fundamentals .
The European Central Bank &apos;s vehement opposition to what is essential to all capitalist economies - the restructuring of failed or insolvent entities &quot; debt - is evidence of the continuing fragility of the Western banking system .
The ECB argued that taxpayers should pick up the entire tab for Greece &apos;s bad sovereign debt , for fear that any private-sector involvement ( PSI ) would trigger a &quot; credit event , &quot; which would force large payouts on credit-default swaps ( CDSs ) , possibly fueling further financial turmoil .
But , if that is a real fear for the ECB - if it is not merely acting on behalf of private lenders - surely it should have demanded that the banks have more capital .
Likewise , the ECB should have barred banks from the risky CDS market , where they are held hostage to ratings agencies &quot; decisions about what constitutes a &quot; credit event . &quot;
Indeed , one positive achievement by European leaders at the recent Brussels summit was to begin the process of reining in both the ECB and the power of the American ratings agencies .
Indeed , the most curious aspect of the ECB &apos;s position was its threat not to accept restructured government bonds as collateral if the ratings agencies decided that the restructuring should be classified as a credit event .
The whole point of restructuring was to discharge debt and make the remainder more manageable .
If the bonds were acceptable as collateral before the restructuring , surely they were safer after the restructuring , and thus equally acceptable .
This episode serves as a reminder that central banks are political institutions , with a political agenda , and that independent central banks tend to be captured ( at least &quot; cognitively &quot; ) by the banks that they are supposed to regulate .
And matters are little better on the other side of the Atlantic .
There , the extreme right threatened to shut down the US government , confirming what game theory suggests : When those who are irrationally committed to destruction if they don &apos;t get their way confront rational individuals , the former prevail .
As a result , President Barack Obama acquiesced in an unbalanced debt-reduction strategy , with no tax increases - not even for the Millionaires who have done so well during the past two decades , and not even by eliminating tax giveaways to oil companies , which undermine economic efficiency and contribute to environmental degradation .
Optimists argue that the short run macroeconomic impact of the deal to raise America &apos;s debt ceiling and prevent sovereign default will be limited - roughly $ 25 billion in expenditure cuts in the coming year .
But the payroll-tax cut ( which put more than $ 100 billion into the pockets of ordinary Americans ) was not renewed , and surely business , anticipating the contractionary effects down the line , will be even more reluctant to lend .
The end of the stimulus itself is contractionary .
And , with housing prices continuing to fall , GDP growth faltering , and unemployment remaining stubbornly high ( one of six Americans who would like a full-time job still cannot get one ) , more stimulus , not austerity , is needed - for the sake of balancing the budget as well .
The single most important driver of deficit growth is weak tax revenues , owing to poor economic performance ; the single best remedy would be to put America back to work .
The recent debt deal is a move in the wrong direction .
There has been much concern about financial contagion between Europe and America .
After all , America &apos;s financial mismanagement played an important role in triggering Europe &apos;s problems , and financial turmoil in Europe would not be good for the US - especially given the fragility of the US banking system and the continuing role it plays in non-transparent CDSs .
But the real problem stems from another form of contagion : Bad ideas move easily across borders , and misguided economic notions on both sides of the Atlantic have been reinforcing each other .
The same will be true of the stagnation that those policies bring .
A Cool Calculus of Global Warming
The British government recently issued the most comprehensive study to date of the economic costs and risks of global warming , and of measures that might reduce greenhouse gas emissions , in the hope of averting some of the direst consequences .
Written under the leadership of Sir Nicholas Stern of the London School of Economics , who succeeded me as Chief Economist of the World Bank , the report makes clear that the question is no longer whether we can afford to do anything about global warming , but whether we can afford not to .
The report proposes an agenda whose cost would be equivalent to just 1 % of annual consumption , but would save the world risk equivalent costs that are five times greater .
The reported costs of global warming are higher than in earlier studies because it takes into account the mounting evidence that the process of global warming is highly complex and non-linear , with a non-negligible chance that it may proceed much faster than had previously been thought and that the extent of warming may be much greater than had previously been thought .
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; Indeed , the study may actually significantly underestimate the costs : For instance , climate change may lead to more weather variability , a possible disappearance or major shift of the Gulf Stream - of particular concern to Europe - and a flourishing of disease .
When I served in 1995 on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , the scientific group that periodically assesses the science of global warming , there was overwhelming evidence that the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere had increased markedly since the beginning of the industrial revolution , that human activity had contributed significantly to those increases , and that they would have profound effects on climate and sea levels .
But few saw , for instance , the Artic ice cap melting as rapidly as now seems to be the case .
Still , some suggest that because we are not certain about how bad global warming will be , we should do little or nothing .
To me , uncertainty should make us act more resolutely today , not less .
As one scientist friend puts it : If you are driving on a mountain road , approaching a cliff , in a car whose brakes may fail , and a fog bank rolls in , should you drive more or less cautiously ?
Global warming is one of those rare instances where the scientific community is more fearful of what may be happening than the population at large .
Scientists have glimpsed what the future may portend .
As the Stern report points out , as usual , the poor are the most vulnerable .
A third of Bangladesh will be underwater by the end of this century .
The Maldives and a host of Pacific Island states will disappear : Our twenty-first-century Atlantis .
To an economist , the problem is obvious : Polluters are not paying the full costs of the damage they cause .
Pollution is a global externality of enormous proportions .
The advanced countries might mean Bangladesh and the disappearing island states no harm , but no war could be more devastating .
A global externality can best be dealt with by a globally agreed tax rate .
This does not mean an increase in overall taxation , but simply a substitution in each country of a pollution ( carbon ) tax for some current taxes .
It makes much more sense to tax things that are bad , like pollution , than things that are good , like savings and work .
Although President George W. Bush says he believes in markets , in this case he has called for voluntary action .
But it makes far more sense to use the force of markets - the power of incentives - than to rely on goodwill , especially when it comes to oil companies that regard their sole objective as maximizing profits , regardless of the cost to others .
Exxon has reportedly been funding so-called think tanks to undermine confidence in the science of global warming , just as the tobacco industry funded &quot; research &quot; to question the validity of statistical findings showing the link between smoking and cancer .
Some companies even seem to celebrate the melting of the polar ice cap , because it will reduce the cost of extracting the oil that lies beneath the Arctic Ocean .
The good news is that there are many ways by which improved incentives could reduce emissions - partly by eliminating the myriad of subsidies for inefficient usages .
The US subsidizes corn-based ethanol , and imposes tariffs on sugar-based ethanol ; hidden in the tax code are billions of dollars of subsidies to the oil and gas industries .
Most importantly , price signals that show the true social costs of energy derived from fossil fuels will encourage innovation and conservation .
Small changes in practices , when replicated by hundreds of millions of people , can make an enormous difference .
For example , simply changing the color of roofs in warm climates to reflect sunlight or planting trees around houses can lead to great savings on energy used for air conditioning .
We have but one planet , and should treasure it .
Global warming is a risk that we simply cannot afford to ignore anymore .
A Cool Head for the Hottest Issues
London - Reading Barack Obama &apos;sDreams from My Father , the US president &apos;s beautifully written reflections on his early life and identity , most people are struck by his cool and intellectual approach .
This is not to say that he is unemotional .
Obama can rage and weep .
But he rarely seems to act on the basis of raw sentiment or instinctive prejudice .
Pragmatic and highly intelligent , sooner or later every issue receives the full attention of his forensic curiosity .
Recalling Hillary Clinton &apos;s famous Democratic primary television advertisement , Obama , it turns out , is exactly the sort of president that most of us would want to have in the post for that 3 a.m. phone call about an international crisis .
He would not be afraid to act , but he would be prepared to think first .
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; I do not think , therefore , that Obama will be too vexed by some of the criticism he faces at the end of his first year in office , though he will undoubtedly Grimace at the defeat of the Democratic candidate in the special election in Massachusetts to fill Ted Kennedy &apos;s old seat .
Obama was praised extravagantly a year ago ; 12 months on , the criticism is over the top , too .
Obama inherited a terrible legacy - recession , financial meltdown , Iraq , Afghanistan .
He has not solved all of these problems .
But it is difficult to see any really bad mistakes , except perhaps allowing himself to be pushed around by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and giving China the impression that he was prepared for a bilateral relationship entirely on China &apos;s terms .
That seems to be changing now .
Obama may have come to understand that when you are the leader of the world &apos;s only superpower , you need to be feared just a little if you are to be respected .
The left in America criticizes Obama for not turning the economy around already .
The right angrily denounces him as a crypto-communist because he wants every American to have health care .
With a dispassionate eye on the long game , what will the president himself be thinking ?
One issue that Obama is certain to have in his sights is a problem that shadowed the world for years .
When I was growing up in the 1950 &quot; s and 1960 &quot; s , world peace was based on the nuclear standoff between the US and the Soviet Union .
The main strategic assessment on both sides of the Berlin Wall was that if either side made a wrong move , all of us might end up consumed in the Flames of a nuclear holocaust .
This was called , in the geostrategic jargon of the day , &quot; mutually assured destruction , &quot; or MAD .
The acronym was entirely appropriate .
We have forgotten those days .
Yet there are still 23,000 nuclear warheads on our planet , with the explosive power of 150,000 Hiroshima bombs .
Terrorist groups would undoubtedly like to get their hands on one .
In all , there are eight nuclear-weapon states - the US , Russia , Britain , France , China , Israel , India , and Pakistan .
North Korea may also have a few bombs . Iran is believed by many to be trying to develop one .
Other states , which have their own civil nuclear capacity , have the potential to develop a weapon .
The number of countries in this category is bound to increase as the number of nuclear power reactors doubles over the next 20 years .
The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) has contained the number of nuclear states .
A conference is to be held in May to renew and review it .
Obama clearly recognizes that the NPT needs to be strengthened in order to prevent countries from turning their civil nuclear-power capacity into weapons .
But Obama also knows that if the existing nuclear states want others to accept tougher restrictions , they will have to cut back their nuclear arsenals .
This is principally an issue for the US and Russia , which possess 95 % of the world &apos;s nuclear weapons .
In addition , it would help if the US could take a strong lead by ratifying the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty .
The nuclear issue is one of the biggest items on the Obama agenda .
How it is handled will help to define his presidency .
Even before the talking gets serious in May , there will be the question of Iran to sort out .
Iran says that it seeks no more than its own ability to produce nuclear power .
Disbelief grows with every revelation of secret Iranian facilities and plans , and with every refusal by Iran to negotiate safeguards that would allow for civil use while preventing weaponization .
The US , the European Union , and Russia have tried to engage Iran on this issue , so far without success .
China seems likely to block effective sanctions on Iran because of its close energy relationship with the country .
How China eventually handles this will profoundly affect its standing in the US and Europe .
These are going to be some of the major questions for Obama over the next year and more .
If he gets them right , he can forget about his short-term critics .
Fortunately , he is smart enough to know this .
A Crisis in Full Flight
Munich - For a while , it looked as if the European Central Bank &apos;s € 1 trillion credit program to pump liquidity into Europe &apos;s banking system had calmed global financial markets .
But now interest rates for Italian and Spanish government bonds are on the rise again , closing in on about 6 % .
Of course , this may not be the breaking point beyond which the debt burden becomes unsustainable .
After all , interest rates in Southern Europe were well above 10 % in the decade before the euro was introduced .
Even Germany at that time had to pay bondholders more than 6 % .
Nevertheless , the markets are clearly signaling growing doubt about whether Spain and Italy will be willing to bear their debt burden .
The main problem is Spain , where private and public-sector foreign debt is larger than that of Greece , Portugal , Ireland , and Italy combined , and , as in Greece , is in the neighborhood of 100 % of GDP ( 93 % to be precise ) .
A quarter of the labor force and half of Spain &apos;s youth are unemployed , reflecting the country &apos;s loss of competitiveness in the wake of the real-estate bubble inflated by cheap euro credit in the pre-crisis period .
The current-account deficit remains at 3.5 % of GDP , despite the recession-induced decline in imports , while economic contraction will cause Spain to miss its budget-deficit target again .
Moreover , Spain &apos;s debt with the ECB &apos;s TARGET settlement system rose by € 55 billion ( $ 72 billion ) between February and March , because capital outflows of that amount had to be compensated .
Since July 2011 , Spain &apos;s TARGET debt has grown by € 199 billion .
Capital is in full flight , more than offsetting the inflows from 2008-2010 .
The cumulative total since the beginning of the first crisis year ( 2008 ) means that Spain has financed its entire current-account deficit via the printing press .
The picture is little better in Italy , where the current-account balance has swung from a surplus of around 2 % of GDP to a 3 % -of-GDP deficit over the last ten years .
The country &apos;s TARGET debt grew by € 76 billion from February to March , with the total since July 2011 reaching € 276 billion .
Italy , too , is being drained of capital ; in fact , the flight of investors accelerated after the ECB &apos;s liquidity injection .
It is now clear that the ECB itself has caused a large part of the capital flight from countries like Spain and Italy , because the cheap credit that it offered drove away private capital .
The purpose of the ECB &apos;s measures was to re-establish confidence and bring about a recovery of the inter-bank market .
In this , too , it has not really been successful , despite the huge amount of money that it put on the table .
Indeed , now the French are looking wobbly .
As capital fled the country between July 2011 and January 2012 , France &apos;s TARGET debt increased by € 95 billion .
France , too , has become uncompetitive , owing to the cheap credit brought by the euro in its initial years .
According to a recent study by Goldman Sachs , the country &apos;s price level must drop by an estimated 20 % vis-à-vis the euro average - that is , depreciate in real terms - if the economy is to regain competitiveness within the eurozone .
Italy will have to depreciate by 10-15 % , and Spain by roughly 20 % .
While Greece and Portugal face the need for deflation totaling 30 % and 35 % , respectively , the figures for Spain and Italy are high enough to justify fears about the future development of the eurozone .
These imbalances can be redressed only with great effort , if at all , and only if one accepts a decade of stagnation .
For Greece and Portugal , staying in the eurozone will be a tight squeeze .
There are many who would solve the problem by routing more and more cheap credit through public channels - bailout funds , eurobonds , or the ECB - from the eurozone &apos;s healthy core to the troubled South .
But this would unfairly force savers and taxpayers in the core countries to provide capital to the South on terms to which they would never voluntarily agree .
Already German , Dutch , and Finish savings amounting to € 15,000 , € 17,000 , and € 21,000 , respectively , per working person have been converted from marketable investments into mere equalization claims against the ECB .
No one knows what these claims will be worth in the event of a eurozone breakup .
Above all , however , the permanent public provision of cheap credit would ultimately lead to a lingering infirmity , if not to Europe &apos;s economic collapse , because the eurozone would become a central management system with state control over investment .
Such systems cannot work , because they eliminate the capital market as the economic system &apos;s main steering mechanism .
One cannot help but wonder how thoughtlessly Europe &apos;s politicians have started down this slippery slope .
A Crisis of Trust
London - Public trust in financial institutions , and in the authorities that are supposed to regulate them , was an early casualty of the financial crisis .
That is hardly surprising , as previously revered firms revealed that they did not fully understand the very instruments they dealt in or the risks they assumed .
It is difficult not to take some private pleasure in this comeuppance for the Masters of the Universe .
But , unfortunately , if this loss of trust persists , it could be costly for us all .
As Ralph Waldo Emerson remarked , &quot; Our distrust is very expensive . &quot;
The Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow made the point in economic terms almost 40 years ago : &quot; It can be plausibly argued that much of the economic backwardness in the world can be explained by the lack of mutual confidence . &quot;
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; Indeed , much economic research has demonstrated a powerful relationship between the level of trust in a community and its aggregate economic performance .
Without mutual trust , economic activity is severely constrained .
Even within Europe , there is powerful evidence that countries where mutual trust is higher achieve higher levels of investment , particularly through venture capital investment , and are prepared to use more flexible contracts , which are also beneficial for growth and investment .
So if it is true that trust in financial institutions - and in the governments that oversee them - has been damaged by the crisis , we should care a lot , and we should be devising responses which seek to rebuild that trust .
In fact , the evidence for a crisis of trust is rather difficult to interpret .
In the United Kingdom , recent survey results are ambiguous .
Surveys promoted by financial firms tend to show that trust in them has not diminished much , and that people continue to trust them even more than they do the National Health Service or the BBC .
Surveys promoted by the BBC tend to show the reverse .
Banks quote statistics to show that they are more trusted than supermarkets , whereas supermarkets cite evidence that the opposite is true , and are expanding into financial services in the belief that the public will trust them more than they trust the banks , which have had to be expensively bailed out by the government .
The market will prove one side right before too long .
In the United States , there is now a more systematic , independent survey promoted by economists at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business .
Their financial trust index , based on a large-scale survey of financial decision-makers in American households , did show a sharp fall in trust in late 2008 and early 2009 , following the collapse of Lehman Brothers .
That fall in confidence affected banks , the stock market , and the government and its regulators .
Furthermore , the survey showed that declining trust was strongly correlated with financial behavior .
In other words , if your trust in the market and in the way it is regulated fell sharply , you were less likely to deposit money in banks or invest in stocks .
So falling trust had real economic consequences .
Fortunately , the latest survey , published in July this year , shows that trust in banks and bankers has begun to recover , and quite sharply . This has been positive for the stock market .
There is also a little more confidence in the government &apos;s response and in financial regulation than there was at the end of last year .
The latter point , which no doubt reflects the Obama administration &apos;s attempts to reform the dysfunctional system it inherited , is particularly important , as the sharpest declines in investment intentions were among those who had lost confidence in the government &apos;s ability to regulate .
It would seem that rebuilding confidence in the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission is economically more important than rebuilding trust in Citibank or AIG .
Continuing disputes in Congress about the precise details of reform could , therefore , have an economic cost if a perception that the system will not be overhauled gains ground .
All these data are at an aggregate level and reflect average views among voters and investors . Yet we also know that individual views are remarkably heterogeneous .
Some people are very trusting of others , and of the firms and institutions with which they do business . Others are congenitally distrustful .
Researchers at the European University Institute in Florence and UCLA recently demonstrated that there is a relationship between trust and individuals &quot; income .
A pan-European opinion survey , which has been carried out for many years , allows us to relate the two .
It asks simple but powerful questions about how far individuals are inclined to trust those with whom they deal .
The data show , intriguingly , that those who show levels of trust well below the average for the country they live in are likely to have lower incomes .
Is that just because low-income people feel that life is unfair and therefore distrust those around them ?
It would seem not , as it is also true that very trusting people also have lower incomes than the average .
In other words , if you diverge markedly from society &apos;s average level of trust , you are likely to lose out , either because you are so distrustful of others that you miss out on opportunities for investment and mutually beneficial exchange , or because you are so trusting that you leave yourself open to being cheated and abused .
When anyone I don &apos;t know says &quot; trust me &quot; - an irritating conversational tic - I usually close my wallet .
Perhaps most academics , who are at the lower end of the skill and qualification-adjusted income scale , do the same .
Maybe we should trust each other more - but not too much .
A Cure for Fiscal Failure ?
Cambridge - Should more countries create independent fiscal advisory councils to infuse greater objectivity into national budget debates ?
Jailed swindler Bernie Madoff recently summed up a lot of people &apos;s feelings about fiscal policy , declaring that &quot; the whole government is a Ponzi scheme . &quot;
Perhaps this was just wishful thinking from a man who will die in prison after his own record-breaking $ 50 billion pyramid scheme collapsed in 2008 .
Personally , I suspect Madoff &apos;s unenviable place in the record books will be secure for quite a while .
Still , with many of the world &apos;s largest governments facing a lethal combination of unsustainable conventional debt , unprecedented old-age pension obligations , and a downshift in growth , one has to wonder what the fiscal plan is .
In a new paper , &quot; A Decade of Debt , &quot; Carmen M. Reinhart and I show that general government debt in the United States , including federal , state , and local debt , has now surpassed the record 120 % of GDP reached at the end of World War II .
Japan , of course , is in even worse shape , with government debt totaling more than 200 % of GDP .
Though this is partially offset by foreign-exchange reserves , Japan now faces massive disaster-relief costs - and this on top of its depressing demographic trends .
Many other rich countries &quot; debt levels are also uncomfortably close to 150-year highs , despite relative peace in much of the world .
There is a no easy way out .
For now , low world interest rates are restraining debt-service costs , but debt levels can be reduced only very gradually over long periods , whereas real ( inflation-adjusted ) interest rates can rise far more quickly , even for rich countries .
Debt crises tend to come out of the blue , hitting countries whose debt trajectories simply have no room for error or unplanned adversity .
The single most immediate and direct impact of having an independent fiscal policy would be to reign in spending by producing a counterpoint to Panglossian government growth and revenue forecasts .
In principle , an independent and respected advisory council could also force governments to acknowledge the hidden costs of government guarantees and off-balance sheet debts .
It is high time to consider novel approaches .
Of course , no one simple change will eliminate the huge bias towards deficit spending in most modern political systems .
And no one simple change will preclude the risk of future debt and inflation crises .
Many countries require sweeping reforms to make their tax systems more efficient and their entitlement programs - including their pension schemes - more realistic .
The recent advent of fiscal advisory councils is a promising institutional start .
A number of countries , including Denmark , the Netherlands , the US , and Belgium , have long-standing fiscal watchdog agencies , such as the US Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) .
But , while these older institutions have proven enormously useful , they are typically quite constrained .
The CBO , for example , is free to issue long-term fiscal projections based on its own best estimates of growth , but is largely forced to accept politically implausible future &quot; fixes &quot; at face value , somewhat neutralizing the potential effectiveness of any critique of deficit policies .
To enhance credibility , a number of governments are gingerly moving towards creating fiscal councils with greater independence , often with central banks as a role model .
The new vanguard includes councils in Sweden , the United Kingdom , Slovenia , and Canada .
The remit of Sweden &apos;s fiscal council is particularly broad , giving it a mandate not only to forecast , but also to look more deeply at the motivations and consequences of government policy .
In principle , an independent fiscal council could have provided invaluable help during the financial crisis .
In the US , such an agency could have weighed in on the costs and benefits of bailout plans , perhaps helping to end congressional paralysis and steeling nerves to give taxpayers more upside risk .
It is too much to expect that these new fiscal institutions will become as important or powerful as central banks , at least anytime soon .
There is far more consensus over monetary policy than over fiscal policy .
And fiscal policy is far more complex and multi-dimensional .
Still , the general principle seems like an important step towards fiscal sanity .
Of course , fiscal councils by themselves are not enough , no matter how well designed they are .
It will remain very tempting for each generation to say , &quot; My grandchildren will be two or three times richer than I , so who cares if they have to pay some debt ? &quot; Moreover , the political cycle creates a very strong deficit bias , as leaders seek to embellish feelings of economic health and prosperity by raising visible expenditures at the cost of hidden debts and lower long-term investment .
To resist these powerful pressures , fiscal councils will need to have their work audited periodically by international agencies such as the International Monetary Fund , both to protect their independence and to promote accountability .
To be sure , Bernie Madoff may yet be proved right , and his will not turn out to be the biggest Ponzi scheme ever .
But greater transparency and a more systematic independent evaluation of government policies could be a very helpful step towards solving the perpetual conundrum of outsized deficits .
It is certainly one of the more innovative and promising ideas to emerge from a rather barren policy landscape .
A Czech Moment
Prague - As I listened to what some Europeans were saying as my country prepared to take over the presidency of the European Union , I heard dim echoes of Neville Chamberlain &apos;s infamous description of Czechoslovakia as &quot; a faraway country of which we know little . &quot;
I suppose that Donald Rumsfeld &apos;s misguided bid a few years ago to incite a divide between &quot; new and old &quot; Europe contributed to the re-emergence of that disdainful attitude .
The reality is that there is no such thing as &quot; old and new &quot; Europe , and there never was .
The break with communism and reunification of Europe is now almost two decades old .
We Czechs are 100 % European , and were even when the Iron Curtain cut us off from democratic Europe .
Indeed , our pro-EU sentiments may be all the stronger because our membership in the Union , like our freedom , is so comparatively new .
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; So no one in Europe needs to fear that the Czech Republic has some nostalgic or idiosyncratic agenda that it wants to impose on the Union .
On the contrary , events have imposed an agenda on Europe that we cannot escape and for which solidarity - true union - will be needed .
The primary , and most pressing , of the problems we face is the financial and economic crisis that is enveloping the EU .
Unfortunately , conditions across the Union will likely worsen before they begin to improve .
The type of social unrest recently witnessed in Greece may spread , because the downturn is likely to take a disproportionate toll on Europe &apos;s young people , who are seeking jobs at a time when hard-pressed European businesses will be able to offer them very few .
It will fall to the Union , once again , to help transform despair into hope .
We Czechs know something about this , as the wrenching economic transition that we underwent in the 1990 &quot; s taught us much about how the right policies can break the grip of hopelessness .
To contain today &apos;s financial and economic crisis , Europe will also need to continue the cooperation that it has shown up to this point .
The very existence of our Union , and particularly of the euro , has already helped to prevent the competitive devaluations and beggar-thy-neighbor policies that ravaged Europe during the 1930 &quot; s - the last time the continent faced so brutal an economic downturn .
But we cannot be complacent that the forces of national egoism will remain in check .
For now , EU governments &quot; coordinated fiscal stimulus has deprived populists of their usual charge that the EU is indifferent to the fate of individuals .
Even more policy coordination will be needed both to confront the crisis and to re-establish EU norms once the storm clouds begin to dissipate .
Although it is right that the Stability and Growth Pact has become more flexible in these extraordinary times , its rules did secure a successful first decade for the euro .
These rules must eventually be restored intact if Europe is to return to the path of sustainable growth , and a consensus will need to be forged now to make that happen .
The second key challenge that we will face during our European presidency is that of Russia .
A new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement ( PCA ) between the EU and the Russian Federation must be negotiated . Those negotiations should have begun seriously last year , but the war in Georgia intervened to put them on hold .
Now those talks have resumed , but the background to the negotiations has changed dramatically .
Russia &apos;s economy is now in far worse shape than that of EU members .
The collapse of world oil and gas prices has wounded Russia &apos;s budget , and lack of investment in the country &apos;s energy sector over the years is now causing the declining production that economists have long predicted .
Until now , Russia has cared less about a new PCA than the EU , because two-thirds of Russia &apos;s exports to the Union comprise natural resources , which bring in cash even without the strong rules that a PCA provides .
Given the stark changes in economic conditions , however , it is now in Russia &apos;s national interest to reassure international markets that it is a reliable place to do business , for which a new PCA would serve as an ideal signal .
Moreover , without a new PCA , individual European countries may feel it necessary to seek even more bilateral agreements with Russia .
Indeed , many EU members have been in a race with each other to see who will be Russia &apos;s closest friend in the Union .
But the bilateral deals that have emerged from this race sometimes come at the expense of other Union members , and may unbalance relations within the Union as a whole . Only a rules-based EU framework can provide a firm foundation for both bilateral and Union-wide relations with Russia .
Europe &apos;s main strength in foreign policy is not its commitment to a rules-based multilateralism , important as that undoubtedly is , but its unity .
When the Georgia crisis erupted , Europe united around a single position on Russia &apos;s withdrawal .
It is the Czech Republic &apos;s task , and that of the Swedish EU presidency that will follow our own , to maintain this unity as the PCA negotiations move forward .
During the 1990 &quot; s , the US and Europe erred in treating Russia with benign neglect . It would be a mistake for Russia to respond in kind today by seeking to prolong the PCA negotiations in the hope that a possibly more amenable EU president may one day offer softer terms .
We , like all EU presidencies , will be representing the wider Union interests when we negotiate .
A Daughter of dictatorship and Democracy
Seoul - It is something of a cliché question in South Korea nowadays : Who would be the country &apos;s next president if the election were held tomorrow , rather than in December 2012 ?
Numerous opinion polls show Park Geun-hye of the ruling Grand National Party ( GNP ) to be the leading candidate .
If elected , she would be South Korea &apos;s first woman president , and , for her rivals , her dominant position in the race is an uncomfortable but unassailable fact .
South Korean voters of all ages and regions have welcomed Park as a candidate for their country &apos;s leadership .
Her political style is both refreshing and relevant , because she comes across as sincere and forthright at a time when the public is hungry for moral leadership .
And she has an astonishing talent for simplifying complicated issues accurately , which she likely learned - along with how to interpret and manipulate the political connotations of every issue - from her father , former President Park Chung-hee .
Acclaimed as a national hero among radical right-wingers , the iron-fisted Park Chung-hee ruled South Korea from 1963 to 1979 , in the wake of the 1961 military coup , only to be assassinated by his intelligence chief .
His daughter is proud of his legacy , which marked the beginning of South Korea &apos;s economic boom .
Indeed , as a pillar of export-oriented modernity , Park Chung-hee was once lionized as the archetype of a modernizing political leadership in military-authoritarian states .
At home , he still ranks first in popularity among the country &apos;s heads of state , kindling nostalgia like a popular old record - a corollary to people &apos;s frustration and anger at the current government of President Lee Myung-bak .
Park , who lost her first bid for the GNP &apos;s nomination to Lee in 2007 , needs to ensure that no rupture with her erstwhile rival knocks her off the path to victory in 2012 .
An astute politician , Park did not hesitate to campaign wholeheartedly for Lee the last time around - a move that , as part of long-term political strategy , made perfect sense .
To many South Koreans , the election is now Park &apos;s to lose .
No candidate on the horizon seems able to stop her .
If she wins , it will be the result of her seriousness and tenacity , not her political heritage .
No one in South Korea &apos;s conservative movement doubts that Park is one of them .
And , as an icon of the right , she is well aware that she cannot afford to betray her status .
Despite her charisma , Park is neither a Sarah Palin nor an Eva Peron .
Indeed , she looks more like a Korean Margaret Thatcher - a lady not for turning , in Thatcher &apos;s famous phrase , and with clearly thought-through political principles animating her actions .
In any case , she seems destined to establish a new South Korea focusing on her landmark pledge &quot; jul pu se , &quot; literally meaning &quot; reduce-loosen-strengthen tax-cuts , &quot; deregulation , and law and order , not just to add another chapter to her father &apos;s old book .
Her administration would mark a fresh departure from the country &apos;s troubled recent past .
Left-leaning pundits claim that the dictator &apos;s daughter has the same autocratic vision as her father , though Park invariably prefers incremental change to radical measures , and cut her political teeth in the tough-minded politics of the GNP .
Others take a flagrantly sexist stance , arguing that a woman president would be a non-starter as long as the North Korean regime continues to threaten national security .
Although these criticisms don &apos;t seem to bother the electorate very much , Park &apos;s path to victory may yet prove narrower than her supporters expect .
She has been called the &quot; Queen of Elections , &quot; in particular since she won a campaign in 2006 after being slashed with a box cutter by a deranged man .
But she must convincingly outline practical strategies to resolve South Korea &apos;s most serious problems , including high unemployment , worsening educational performance , and North Korea &apos;s nuclear weapons program .
Ms. Park once pledged to provide loans for working-class families from elementary school to college years , while contending that local universities should be empowered to have more autonomy .
She favors engagement policy and the six-party talks so as to resolve the nuclear troubles .
Come presidential election-day in 2012 , South Korean voters will pick the candidate who embodies pragmatism and centrism over a partisan or ideologue .
Park &apos;s success will depend , in the end , on the effectiveness of her campaign in further defining her character along those lines .
Unlike former Peruvian dictator Alberto Fujimori &apos;s daughter , who lost her presidential bid in Peru last month , Park is likely to defy her family &apos;s tragic history .
If she does , she will be Asia &apos;s most powerful woman , perhaps the most powerful in the world , at the end of next year .
A Day for Planetary Justice
Princeton - What we are doing to our planet , to our children and grandchildren , and to the poor , by our heedless production of greenhouse gases , is one of the great moral wrongs of our age .
On October 24 , you can stand up against this injustice .
October 24 is 350 Day .
The name comes from the number of parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that , according to Jim Hansen , perhaps the world &apos;s leading climate scientist , we should not exceed if we are to avoid potentially catastrophic climate change .
It is a measure of the seriousness of our problem that CO2 is already at 386 ppm , and is rising by two ppm each year .
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; The need to cut greenhouse gases has become increasingly clear as predictions of global warming - denounced as &quot; alarmist &quot; when they were first made just a few years ago - have repeatedly turned out to have been too conservative .
We are approaching a point of no return , at which feedback loops will kick in and continue to warm the planet , no matter what we do .
The melting of arctic ice is one example .
Four hundred years ago , explorers sought the legendary &quot; Northeast Passage &quot; across the north of Europe and Russia to China .
They found the arctic ice impenetrable , and soon gave up their quest .
This year , commercial vessels successfully navigated the Northeast Passage .
That is one of many recent dramatic signs that our climate is changing and that our planet is warmer than it has been for a very long time .
But ice-free arctic waters are more than a symptom of global warming .
They are themselves a cause of further warming : Ice and snow reflect the sun &apos;s rays .
An ice-free surface absorbs more warmth from the sun than one covered in snow or ice . In other words , our greenhouse gas emissions have , by causing enough warming to melt the arctic ice , created a feedback loop that will generate more warming , and melt more ice , even if we were to stop emitting all greenhouse gases tomorrow .
Other feedback loops pose a similar danger .
In Siberia , vast quantities of methane , an extremely potent greenhouse gas , are locked up in what used to be called &quot; permafrost &quot; - regions in which it was assumed that the ground was permanently frozen .
But areas that used to be frozen are now thawing , releasing methane and thus contributing to further warming - and to further thawing , which releases more methane .
Developing nations are grasping just how outrageous the current distribution of greenhouse-gas emissions really is .
At the United Nations Summit on Climate Change in September , President Paul Kagame of Rwanda pointed out that , while developed nations outside Africa are almost entirely responsible for the problem , its greatest impact will probably be on Africa , which has few resources to cope with the challenge .
Kagame then suggested giving every country an annual per capita quota for CO2 emissions , and allowing developing countries that are below the quota to trade their excess quota with countries that are above theirs .
The money that developing countries would receive for this would not be aid , but rather a recognition that the rich nations must pay for something that in the past they simply appropriated : Far more than their fair share of our atmosphere &apos;s capacity to absorb our waste gases .
Sri Lanka took a similar stance , using studies from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to calculate that in 2008 , environmentally permissible carbon emissions totaled no more than 2,172 kilograms per person .
In fact , the world &apos;s per capita emissions were 4,700 kilograms , or more than double the permissible limit .
But , while emissions in the rich nations were far above the permissible limit , Sri Lankan emissions were , at 660 kilograms , well below it .
As Sri Lanka &apos;s government pointed out , &quot; That means low-emitting countries like us could not emit more because our space has already been exploited by developed or global heavy polluting countries without our consent . &quot;
This situation is an injustice of vast proportions , reminiscent of - and arguably much worse than - the now-repudiated colonialism of the Western powers in the nineteenth century .
The task of remedying it must begin at the meeting on climate change that will be held in Copenhagen in December .
Many political leaders have expressed support for strong action on climate change , but what most of them regard as &quot; strong action &quot; will not be enough to get us back below 350 ppm .
In some countries , including the United States , there are major political obstacles to taking even modest steps .
On October 24 , people in nearly every country will be taking action to raise awareness of the need for an international treaty to bring our atmosphere back to 350 ppm of CO2 .
There will be climbers hanging banners high in the Himalayas , where the glaciers are melting , and scuba divers at Australia &apos;s Great Barrier Reef , which is threatened by climate change .
Churches will ring bells 350 times , 350 cyclists will circle towns , and , in many places , 350 trees will be planted .
Atwww.350.org you can find out what is happening near you and join in , or put your own idea online .
But don &apos;t just sit back and hope that others will do enough to make an impact .
One day your grandchildren will ask you : What did you do to meet the greatest moral challenge of your time ?
A Day of Liberation
When I was seven years old , in 1960 , my grandmother Angelica opened my eyes to the meaning of 8 May 1945 , the day when Nazi Germany surrendered and World War II ended in Europe .
We were spending our summer holidays in Normandy where the liberation of Europe from Nazism had started on D-Day , 6 June 1944 .
One evening , I listened to my parents and my grandmother talking about the past .
I have forgotten the details of their conversation , but I can still hear my grandmother &apos;s sigh of relief when she said &quot; Thank God we lost that war ! &quot;
From a child &apos;s perspective , it wasn &apos;t self-evident that losing was a good thing .
But of course , my grandmother was right to equate defeat with liberation .
The more I have thought about the lesson she taught me 45 years ago , the clearer I have seen another , less obvious dimension in what she said : It is &quot; we &quot; who lost the war .
Collectively , the Germans had not been the innocent victims of a small gang of criminal outsiders called &quot; Nazis &quot; - Nazism had been an inside ideology supported by millions of Germans , and every German was liable for its atrocities whether or not he or she had adhered to it individually .
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; In today &apos;s Germany , an overwhelming majority subscribes to the proposition that 8 May 1945 was a day of liberation - not only for Europe , but also for Germany itself .
Compared to public opinion in 1960 , that &apos;s certainly an enormous progress .
But paradoxically , it may also contain an element of forgetfulness , because it tends to conceal the fact that liberation required a military defeat .
To use my grandmother &apos;s parlance , it is not &quot; us &quot; who were the liberators , but &quot; them . &quot;
The way people see the past tells us more about their present attitudes than about the past itself .
This is what the term &quot; politics of memory &quot; is meant to indicate .
And this is why it doesn &apos;t matter whether the relevant events happened 60 years ago ( as World War II ) , 90 years ( as in the case of the Armenian genocide ) or even 600 years ( such as the battle of Kosovo in 1389 ) .
A violent conflict in the past may survive as a war of memories in the present , as can be observed in the current dispute between China and South Korea on one side , and Japan on the other .
A war of memories , in turn , may sometimes lead to a violent conflict in the future .
Former perpetrators often try to de-legitimize their former victims &quot; moral superiority by claiming they were victims themselves .
Therefore , the 60th anniversary of the firebombing of Dresden by Allied forces on 13 February 1945 has probably been a more crucial moment in terms of the German &quot; politics of memory &quot; than the 60th anniversary of 8 May 1945 is going to be .
Far-right groups infamously dubbed the attack by which at least 30,000 people were killed &quot; Dresden &apos;s Holocaust of bombs . &quot;
Fortunately , their propaganda campaign has been a failure .
Although it is true that thousands of the civilians killed in Dresden and other German cities were innocent at an individual level , there can be no doubt it was morally imperative that Germany be defeated collectively .
On the left side of the German political spectrum , the proposition that 8 May 1945 was a day of liberation remains unchallenged .
However , it is sometimes repressed that the massive use of force had been necessary to achieve that result .
Left-wing pacifism tends to overlook this simple fact .
Its slogan &quot; Never again war ! &quot; Is only half the truth - the other half is &quot; Never again appeasement ! &quot; 8 May 1945 was not &quot; zero hour , &quot; as a popular saying in Germany goes .
It had an antecedent , that is , a lack of pre-emptive resistance at home and abroad to the threat that built up in Nazi Germany during the 1930 &quot; s .
There is yet another lesson to be learned .
Yes , 8 May 1945 was a day of liberation to which the Soviet army contributed decisively .
But for millions of Central and East Europeans , liberation was followed by Stalin &apos;s oppressive regime .
The current war of memories between the Baltic republics and Russia , with regard to the international celebration in Moscow on 9 May this year , reminds Germany of a special historic responsibility .
The German-Soviet non-aggression treaty , the so-called Hitler-Stalin pact , concluded in August 1939 , had been supplemented by a secret appendix dividing the border states Finland , Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Poland and Romania into spheres of interest for the two parties .
But excusing Nazi atrocities by pointing to Stalinist crimes is an intellectually and morally unacceptable stratagem .
When Chancellor Schröder travels to Moscow for the Red Square celebrations , he should bear in mind Nazi Germany &apos;s contribution to the Baltic tragedy .
On 8 May this year , public speakers will remind us how important it is not to forget .
They will stress that if the lessons of history are not learned , history is bound to repeat itself .
All this is perfectly true .
But personally , I will also remember my grandmother &apos;s sentence &quot; Thank God we lost that war ! &quot;
Thank God - and thanks to all those brave Allied soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the sake of Europe &apos;s liberty .
A De-globalized World ?
Cambridge - It may take a few months or a couple of years , but one way or another the United States and other advanced economies will eventually recover from today &apos;s crisis .
The world economy , however , is unlikely to look the same .
Even with the worst of the crisis over , we are likely to find ourselves in a somewhat de-globalized world , one in which international trade grows at a slower pace , there is less external finance , and rich countries &quot; appetite for running large current-account deficits is significantly diminished .
Will this spell doom for developing countries ?
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; Not necesarily .
Growth in the developing world tends to come in three distinct variants .
First comes growth driven by foreign borrowing .
Second is growth as a by-product of commodity booms .
Third is growth led by economic restructuring and diversification into new products .
The first two models are at greater risk than the third .
But we should not lose sleep over them , because they are flawed and ultimately unsustainable .
What should be of greater concern is the potential plight of countries in the last group .
These countries will need to undertake major changes in their policies to adjust to today &apos;s new realities .
The first two growth models invariably come to a bad end .
Foreign borrowing can enable consumers and governments to live beyond their means for a while , but reliance on foreign capital is an unwise strategy .
The problem is not only that foreign capital flows can easily reverse direction , but also that they produce the wrong kind of growth , based on overvalued currencies and investments in non-traded goods and services , such as housing and construction .
Growth driven by high commodity prices is also susceptible to busts , for similar reasons . Commodity prices tend to move in cycles .
When they are high , they are apt to crowd out investments in manufactures and other , non-traditional tradables .
Moreover , commodity booms frequently produce ugly politics in countries with weak institutions , leading to costly struggles for resource rents , which are rarely invested wisely .
So it is no surprise that the countries that have produced steady , long-term growth during the last six decades are those that relied on a different strategy : Promoting diversification into manufactured and other &quot; modern &quot; goods .
By capturing a growing share of world markets for manufactures and other non-primary products , these countries increased their domestic employment opportunities in high-productivity activities .
Their governments pursued not just good &quot; fundamentals &quot; ( e.g. , macroeconomic stability and an outward orientation ) , but also what might be called &quot; productivist &quot; policies : Undervalued currencies , industrial policies , and financial controls .
China exemplified this approach .
Its growth was fueled by an extraordinarily rapid structural transformation towards an increasingly sophisticated set of industrial goods .
In recent years , China also got hooked on a large trade surplus vis-à-vis the US - the counterpart of its undervalued currency .
But it wasn &apos;t just China .
Countries that had been growing rapidly in the run-up to the great crash of 2008 typically had trade surpluses ( or very small deficits ) .
These countries did not want to be recipients of capital inflows , because they realized that this would wreak havoc with their need to maintain competitive currencies .
It is now part of conventional wisdom that large external balances - typified by the bilateral US-China trade relationship - played a major contributing role in the great crash .
Global macroeconomic stability requires that we avoid such large current-account imbalances in the future .
But a return to high growth in developing countries requires that they resume their push into tradable goods and services .
In the past , this push was accommodated by the willingness of the US and a few other developed nations to run large trade deficits .
This is no longer a feasible strategy for large or middle-income developing countries .
So , are the requirements of global macroeconomic stability and of growth for developing countries at odds with each other ?
Will developing countries &quot; need to generate large increases in the supply of industrial products inevitably clash with the world &apos;s intolerance of trade imbalances ?
There is in fact no inherent conflict , once we understand that what matters for growth in developing countries is not the size of their trade surpluses , nor even the volume of their exports .
What matters is their output of modern industrial goods ( and services ) , which can expand without limit as long as domestic demand expands simultaneously .
Maintaining an undervalued currency has the upside that it subsidizes the production of such goods ; but it also has the downside that it taxes domestic consumption - which is why it generates a trade surplus .
By encouraging industrial production directly , it is possible to have the upside without the downside .
There are many ways that this can be done , including reducing the cost of domestic inputs and services through targeted investments in infrastructure .
Explicit industrial policies can be an even more potent instrument .
The key point is that developing countries that are concerned about the competitiveness of their modern sectors can afford to allow their currencies to appreciate ( in real terms ) as long as they have access to alternative policies that promote industrial activities more directly .
So the good news is that developing countries can continue to grow rapidly even if world trade slows in and there is reduced appetite for capital flows and trade imbalances .
Their growth potential need not be severely affected as long as the implications of this new world for domestic and international policies are understood .
One such implication is that developing countries will have to substitute real industrial policies for those that operate through the exchange rate .
Another is that external policy actors ( for example , the World Trade Organization ) will have to be more tolerant of these policies as long as the effects on trade balances are neutralized through appropriate adjustments in the real exchange rate .
Greater use of industrial policies is the price to be paid for a reduction of macroeconomic imbalances .
A Decade of Hugo Chávez
San Jose - We should have known that something was amiss when , during President Hugo Chávez &apos;s inauguration on February 2 , 1999 , he swore on Venezuela &apos;s 40-year-old Constitution by declaring it &quot; moribund . &quot;
Under &quot; the moribund , &quot; as the Constitution came to be known , Venezuela not only had eight peaceful presidential transitions , but also enjoyed the fruits of democratic pluralism and strong civil and political liberties .
Of course , during this period Venezuela produced as much corruption and political irresponsibility as it did barrels of oil .
Nonetheless , Venezuela fared far better than the average Latin American country .
It wasn &apos;t Switzerland , but , by anyone &apos;s measure , it was a genuine democracy .
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; Not anymore .
Elections are still held , but the legacy of Chávez &apos;s decade in power consists , first and foremost , in the demolition of democratic institutions .
Elected in a landslide to clean up the political vices of the previous establishment , Chávez chose to throw the baby out with the bathwater .
The previous regime , including its system of checks and balances and its tradition of political tolerance , did disappear , but its vices - particularly graft and demagoguery - became worse than ever .
Pretty much like 10 years ago , Venezuela , once a destination for immigrants from around the world , remains under-developed .
More fundamentally , Chávez represents ideas that have long stifled Latin America &apos;s political and economic growth . This includes the notion that social justice can be achieved only by abandoning the path of reform and rejecting &quot; bourgeois &quot; democratic forms in favor of &quot; real &quot; democracy , born of revolutionary purity and the leader &apos;s millenarian dreams .
That &apos;s simply false .
Though the Chávez revolution has made progress against poverty and inequality , it is hardly sustainable and reeks of patronage .
In fact , one can find similar achievements in Chile and Brazil , which have not given up on democratic checks and balances , political pluralism , or freedom of the press , and have not enjoyed the luxury of $ 300 billion in oil revenue in the space of one decade .
Moreover , it ought not to be forgotten that between 1950 and 1980 , Venezuela itself reduced extreme poverty from 43 % to 8 % of the population , one of the lowest figures in Latin America .
It did so with democracy and freedom .
Chávez also repeats , ad nauseam , the idea that others are to blame for Latin America &apos;s ills .
This is the pernicious victimization narrative - still very popular in universities across Latin America - the late Venezuelan journalist Carlos Rangel eloquently refuted in books such asThe Third World ideology .
It is obvious that Yankee imperialism cannot be blamed for Venezuela &apos;s emaciated tax system , dismally bad schools , rampant corruption , high crime rate , and feeble political institutions .
In all of these areas , Venezuela is faring poorly even by Latin America &apos;s low standards . This is particularly true in the case of institutional weakness .
When Chávez declares &quot; moribund &quot; a legitimate constitution , or when he proclaimsl &quot; état c &apos;est moi by declaring a national holiday to commemorate his 10 years in power , we see eloquent examples of a homemade institutional Farce that would doom any country to the ninth circle of misery .
None of these ideas would fly , of course , in a contented nation .
In this sense , Venezuela &apos;s experience speaks to all of Latin America .
The combination of economic growth ( now in reverse because of the global crisis ) and atrocious levels of inequality and social segmentation will continue to breed the same unmet expectations and social resentment that cleared Chávez &apos;s path to power .
As long as Latin America &apos;s democracies fail to take seriously the tasks of reducing inequality , spreading opportunity , and nurturing more cohesive societies , they will continue to court disaster .
To avoid this outcome , it is vital to purge certain reactionary and numbing beliefs , including the idea that reducing poverty obviates the need to address inequality , or that development is possible without introducing modern and progressive tax systems .
If the tenth anniversary of Chávez &apos;s tenure can serve as a reminder of the perils that beset unjust democracies - especially now that a new electoral cycle in Latin America looms - then Venezuela &apos;s agonizing recent history would , at least , be redeemed .
A Declaration of Independence from the US
George W. Bush is obsessed with the war on terrorism , especially with the military response to terrorism . American foreign policy reflects that obsession .
This year , the US will spend around $ 450 billion for the military , including the costs of the Iraq War , while it will spend no more than $ 15 billion to overcome global poverty , global environmental degradation , and global diseases .
In other words , US foreign policy spending is thirty times more focused on the military than on building global prosperity , global public health , and a sustainable environment .
Throughout 2003 , the world lived with Bush &apos;s obsession .
Debate over Iraq dominated international diplomacy , and took up almost the entire UN agenda .
The war in Iraq cost countless innocent lives , such as when the UN headquarters in Baghdad was bombed .
At the same time , Bush &apos;s emphasis on a one-dimensional , militarized approach to global problems has fueled unrest and instability throughout the Islamic world , leading to increased terrorism in Turkey , North Africa , Saudi Arabia , and Southeast Asia .
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; The nature of suffering around the world hardly justifies this narrow strategy .
Focusing on terrorism to the exclusion of other issues , and emphasizing the military response to it , will not bring prosperity and peace , or even a significant reduction in the number of attacks .
While 3,000 innocent people died in the US on September 11 , 2001 , in Africa 8,000 innocent children die every day from malaria .
Yet malaria is preventable and treatable .
The problem is that most of Africa is too poor to mobilize the methods of prevention ( bed nets ) and treatments ( anti-malarial medicines ) that could save millions of children every year .
The US spends more on Iraq each day than it does on Africa &apos;s malaria in a year .
As 2003 draws to a close , it is time for world leaders to help guide the world away from the obsessive , failing approach of America &apos;s government .
President Bush should be made to understand that the US will find no true international support if America speaks incessantly about terrorism while doing almost nothing about the problems that really affect most of the world : Poverty , lack of access to safe water and sanitation , vulnerability to disease , and climate change .
Ironically , President Bush claims that the UN does not follow through on its word .
He declared in London recently that &quot; the credibility of the UN depends on a willingness to keep its word and to act when action is required . &quot;
Yet the US repeatedly violates its own UN pledges .
For example , at the International Conference on Financing for Development , in Monterrey , Mexico in March 2002 , America signed the Monterrey Consensus , which includes a promise by rich countries to raise their development assistance towards 0.7 % of national income .
That would bring an additional $ 60 billion per year in foreign assistance from the US--approximately what it spent on Iraq this year . Yet President Bush has simply ignored this promise .
There are many other similar commitments that the US has made in recent years to the UN that remain utterly unfulfilled .
The US promised action to fight man-made climate change as a signatory to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCC ) in 1992 .
It has so far failed to act .
America also promised--in the Doha Declaration in 2001--to open its markets to the world &apos;s poorest countries .
Yet at Cancun , Mexico earlier this summer , it refused to open its markets even to exports from struggling African economies .
The list goes on and on .
At the Millennium Assembly in 2000 , the US promised to pursue reduction of global poverty , yet it has taken few steps in that direction .
At the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002 , America committed itself to protect global ecosystems , yet little has been seen or heard from US policy makers on this issue since then .
America is certainly not alone in failing to promote the international goals adopted in the UN .
But because the US is the richest , most powerful country in the world , its neglect is devastating .
If the US really wants to undercut terrorism , it must recognize the interconnectedness of extremism , poverty , and environmental degradation , and it will need to understand the struggles for survival that are underway among the poor everywhere .
But the world should not wait for the America to come to its senses .
The US represents just 5 % of the world &apos;s population , and just one vote of 191 countries in the UN General Assembly .
Poor countries , especially the democracies of the developing world--Brazil , South Africa , India , Mexico , Ghana , the Philippines--should say , &quot; We need to act on the issues that concern us , not just on the issues that concern the US . &quot;
What the world needs most in 2004 is a declaration of independence from American willfulness .
A Democratic windfall for Turkey ?
Turkey &apos;s seeming fall from grace with the US may turn out to be a blessing in disguise .
The Iraq war and the tortured diplomacy that led up to it may help resolve Turkey &apos;s conflict between its &quot; strategic alliance &quot; with America and its drive to join the EU .
The elections last November that brought the Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) to power were preceded by a dispute between the members of the then-ruling coalition over enacting the reforms demanded by the EU .
Some liberal elements of that &quot; secular &quot; coalition resigned from the government and joined with the Islamists to push the reforms through parliament .
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; After coming to power , the AKP &apos;s leaders , former Islamists who had reinvented themselves as &quot; conservative democrats , &quot; energetically engaged with the US , the EU , and the UN on issues ranging from Cyprus to Iraq , from Kurdish language rights to other human rights issues within Turkey .
Having suffered the oppressive practices of Turkey &apos;s &quot; secular &quot; state and recognizing that human rights must be protected across-the-board , the AKP emerged as a credible interlocutor with the West .
The US , preoccupied with the supposed specter of a &quot; clash of civilizations &quot; between Islam and the West , saw the AKP &apos;s modern , westernized face as an opportunity and urged the EU to admit Turkey .
Today , both &quot; conservative democrats &quot; and Liberals advocate passing all the reforms needed to gain accession to the EU , while opponents include extreme nationalists , of both left and right , as well as some elements of the &quot; secular &quot; establishment .
The Europeans could have tipped the balance decisively in favor of the reformers by finally rewarding the efforts of the pro-EU Turks at last December &apos;s summit of EU leaders .
Instead , the EU kept Turkey waiting yet again , putting off formal negotiations that , in any case , may take years to complete .
Europe &apos;s persistent reluctance puts the Turks in a quandary .
The Americans want full EU membership for Turkey--a longstanding NATO member and close American ally--while Europeans complain about the Turkish military &apos;s domestic political role .
The paradox is that , by maintaining a political distance and thus limiting Turkey &apos;s options , Europe may end up reinforcing Turkey &apos;s status as a military outpost of the US .
At least , that was how things were shaping up prior to the war in Iraq . Then , despite massive US pressure , Turkey &apos;s parliament unexpectedly rejected the government &apos;s proposal to allow US troops in Turkey to launch an invasion from Turkish territory .
Turkey &apos;s refusal to grant the Americans access to military bases on its territory effectively ruled out a northern front in the war .
The Turkish government even attempted a regional initiative for a peaceful solution to the crisis , an effort no current EU member could have contemplated .
Parliament &apos;s rejection of US troops powerfully refutes suggestions that Turkey was primarily concerned about the size of the American aid package on offer as an inducement to cooperate .
Suggestions that characterized the vote as revealing the government &apos;s true &quot; Islamic &quot; character ignore the fact that the only opposition party in parliament , the Republican People &apos;s Party--founded by Atatürk and still fully &quot; secularist &quot; --voted against the plan .
Likewise , other elements of Turkey &apos;s secular establishment , including the President and the military leadership , either opposed or were lukewarm , at best , to the idea of war in Iraq .
Turkey &apos;s military initially remained silent on the issue , uncharacteristically watching the civilian political process unfold .
By contrast , the military had earlier publicly criticized AKP initiatives on Cyprus .
Their silence on Iraq reflected their apprehension about unwanted alternatives : Either support the US plan and risk encouraging Kurdish moves toward an independent state , or oppose the Americans and jeopardize a critical strategic relationship .
They chose to defer to the civilian leadership and to parliament , which , in voting down the US plan , reflected overwhelming public sentiment against the war .
Only after the vote did the Chief of Staff publicly endorse the original proposal to bring in American troops .
In fact , the allegedly Islamic party had skilfully managed to negotiate with an unrelenting US , consult with the Turkish military and President , and share all information with the public and parliament .
Walking a fine line in what was essentially a lose-lose situation , the party leadership laid out the stakes clearly and judiciously left the final decision to parliament .
The outcome was a victory for Turkish democracy and recognized as such internationally .
After the US military action in Iraq , the tables may be turning in surprising ways .
As America establishes itself in Iraq , Turkey &apos;s geopolitical military significance may decline .
Yet the declared American aim of building a Muslim democracy in Iraq will only enhance Turkey &apos;s symbolic importance as a role model .
This shift in Turkey &apos;s strategic role may also be reflected in a new domestic balance between the military and the forces pushing for reform .
With careful management , Turkey may find itself drawing closer to Europe , while rebuilding its relationship with America .
A devaluation Option for Southern Europe
Cambridge - This year is likely to mark a make-or-break ordeal for the euro .
The eurozone &apos;s survival demands a credible solution to its long-running sovereign-debt crisis , which in turn requires addressing the two macroeconomic imbalances - &amp; nbsp ; external and fiscal - &amp; nbsp ; which are at the heart of that crisis .
The crisis has exposed the deep disparities in competitiveness that have developed within the eurozone .
From 1996 to 2010 , unit labor costs in Germany increased by just 8 % , and by 13 % in France .
Compare that to 24 % in Portugal , 35 % in Spain , 37 % in Italy , and a whopping 59 % in Greece .
The result has been large trade imbalances between eurozone countries , a problem compounded by large fiscal deficits and high levels of public debt in southern Europe ( and France ) - much of it owed to foreign creditors .
Does addressing these imbalances require breaking up the eurozone ?
Suppose , for example , that Portugal were to leave and re-introduce the escudo .
The ensuing exchange-rate devaluation would immediately lower the price of Portugal &apos;s exports , raise its import prices , stimulate the economy , and bring about much-needed growth .
But a euro exit would be a messy affair .
The resulting turmoil could very well trump any short-term gains in competitiveness from devaluation .
There is a remarkably simple alternative that does not require southern Europe &apos;s troubled economies to abandon the euro and devalue their exchange rates .
It involves increasing the value-added tax while cutting payroll taxes .
Our recent research demonstrates that such a &quot; fiscal devaluation &quot; has very similar effects on the economy in terms of its impact on GDP , consumption , employment , and inflation .
A currency devaluation works by making imports more costly and exports cheaper .
A VAT / payroll-tax swap would do exactly the same thing .
An increase in VAT raises the price of imported goods , as foreign firms face a higher tax .
To ensure that domestic firms do not have an incentive to raise prices , an increase in VAT needs to be accompanied by a cut in payroll taxes .
Moreover , since exports are exempt from VAT , the price of domestic exports will fall .
The desired competitiveness effects of exchange-rate devaluation can thus be had while staying in the euro .
This policy can also help on the fiscal front .
As is true of an exchange-rate devaluation , the positive impact on growth of an increase in competitiveness can strengthen the fiscal position by raising tax revenues .
Moreover , an important advantage of fiscal devaluations is that they generate additional revenues in proportion to the country &apos;s trade deficit .
For countries that are suffering from weak competitiveness and , as a consequence , running trade deficits , this typically means more revenues , especially in the short run .
Like exchange-rate devaluations , fiscal devaluations create winners and losers .
Both act as a wealth levy : Inflation means that bondholders suffer a real loss in proportion to their wealth and the size of the devaluation .
If taxes on capital are not adjusted , holders of domestic stocks suffer a comparable loss .
By contrast , many transfers , such as unemployment benefits , health benefits , and public pensions , are indexed to inflation , and thus maintain their real value .
The same is true of minimum wages .
These distributive effects play an important role in the politics of exchange-rate devaluations , and most of these effects appear in fiscal devaluations as well .
Fiscal devaluations already have some advocates .
Indeed , French President Nicolas Sarkozy &apos;s government just announced one .
And concerns that a fiscal devaluation will conflict with euro rules can be met by simply pointing out that Germany &apos;s government carried one out in 2007 , though by another name , when it raised VAT from 16 % to 19 % and cut employers &quot; contribution to social insurance , from 6.5 % to 4.2 % .
In short , there are simple fiscal alternatives to exchange-rate devaluation that can address southern Europe &apos;s short-term competitiveness problems .
To be sure , feasible fiscal devaluations would be limited in size .
But , together with debt restructuring , accommodative monetary policy , liquidity support from the European Central Bank , and much-required structural reforms , they can help to put these troubled economies on a sound footing without a euro breakup or a major austerity-induced recession .
A Doomsday Scenario
As America debates whether or not to invade Iraq , fears that the country &apos;s economic recovery will stall are beginning to creep into the discussion ; with that , worries about the health of the global economy are growing , too .
A consensus is emerging that the gap between the US economy &apos;s growth potential and its actual performance will remain large for some time to come .
Can the situation get worse ? Yes , it can : Much worse .
A number of worrying factors about the US economy have been around for a long time :
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; huge trade deficits have persisted since Ronald Reagan &apos;s misguided tax cuts of 1981 converted America from the world &apos;s largest creditor into the world &apos;s largest debtor .
Today , these deficits set new records by the month ;
America &apos;s appallingly low savings rate .
When American wealth seemed to be growing year after year as the stock market boomed , this was understandable ; individual Americans were becoming richer without savings , so why bother ?
Today &apos;s savings rate , while it has increased slightly , still finds America at the bottom of the world &apos;s savings league tables ;
Lax accounting standards .
The Arthur Anderson , Enron , and WorldCom scandals didn &apos;t emerge out of thin air , but had their origins in the mid-1990s , when the US Treasury actually intervened to stop attempts by the supposedly independent accounting standards board to improve matters .
Bad accounting contributed to the recent stock market bubble ; bad information led to stock prices that did not reflect underlying realities ; and these in turn provided incentives for the excess investment in telecoms that caused today &apos;s excess capacity .
To this old brew , new ingredients have been added , notably the most rapid change in a nation &apos;s fiscal posture the world has probably ever seen .
In a &quot; now you see it , now you don &apos;t &quot; move only a magician should love , the $ 3 trillion , ten year ( non social security ) US budget surplus was - in a matter of months - converted into a gapingdeficit of $ 2 trillion dollars .
Of course , excuses are at hand : The magnitude of the economic downturn was not anticipated and the increased expenditures to fight terrorism could not be foretold .
Excuses , excuses .
As the old saying goes : Don &apos;t count your chickens before they hatch . The Bush Administration not only counted its chickens , it sold them forward !
To anyone with decent eyesight , it was clear that the rosy budget projections of two years ago were nonsense .
Clear , too , was the fact that , in promoting its tax cuts , the Bush Administration was engaging ( on a multi-billion dollar scale ) in dishonest , Enron-like accounting .
So if things are so bad now , how can they get worse ?
Here &apos;s a plausible scenario .
To finance its trade deficit , America must borrow from abroad over a billion dollars a day .
When America was the only safe haven for global investors , this was easy .
But America today appears less safe .
The combination of lack of confidence in US corporate accounts , lack of confidence in America &apos;s economic policy management ( compounded by the mounting deficits ) , and America &apos;s soft underlying economic fundamentals , has dented the US economy &apos;s global reputation .
As foreigners start pulling their money out of a country they suspect , the dollar will weaken .
As the dollar weakens , America looks even less safe . So a rush to the door begins .
While a weak dollar may be good for exports , a falling dollar will be accompanied by stock market losses and greater declines in confidence .
Eventually , even the Almighty American consumer will be shaken and realize that he is poorer today than three years ago and that he better start putting money away for his retirement , especially given Bush &apos;s proposed risky experiments with the social security system .
At that point , Americans will join the stampede out of their economy .
Why shouldn &apos;t they ?
They &apos;re free to choose where to put their money . Europe &apos;s stock markets will begin to look like an attractive alternative .
But this scenario offers no happy ending for Europe .
A weakening US economy and the strengthening Euro will dampen European exports .
The European Central Bank , fixated on inflation , will be slow to lower interest rates , and the European Stability Pact will make it impossible for fiscal policy to offset these weaknesses .
Europe will join America in a downturn , reinforcing America &apos;s decline and setting in motion a global downward spiral .
I am not predicting that this will happen .
I hope that the Bush Administration will enact policies to strengthen the US economy : A tax cut that might made minimal sense when itseemedthat the US had a multi-trillion dollar surplus no longer makes any sense at all .
The Bush Administration should admit this , and redesign a tax program to strengthen the economy by making the country live within its means .
President Bush could even stabilize the economy , offering better unemployment benefits to provide needed stimulus if the downturn continues .
America is strong , and the global economy is strong .
Should the disastrous events contemplated here occur , a new global economy will eventually emerge from the ashes .
Downturns , of course , can never be fully prevented .
We can , however , decrease their frequency ; we can make them shallower ; we can ensure that fewer people are hurt and that those that get hurt are better protected .
Sadly , we are doing less than is possible to prevent things from getting worse and doing less than necessary to protect ourselves from the consequences .
A Drug War on Auto-Pilot
The Hague - The war in Afghanistan , now approaching its tenth year , may seem to many to have no end in sight , but Latin America has endured an even longer fight , one that has recently become much more bloody : The &quot; war &quot; against drug trafficking .
So rote - and so violent - has that war become that many people in Latin America now wonder which side is suffering the more pathological addiction .
The new strategy that US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been promoting to staunch the upward trend of Narco-trafficking-related murders - which leaked Mexican government reports put at more than 22,000 since late 2006 - is to build &quot; stronger , more resilient communities . &quot;
Ciudad Juárez , a sprawling Mexican border town that is now the homicide capital of the world , would have to be high on the list .
Four bridges and innumerable tunnels and drainage canals connect Ciudad Juárez and El Paso , Texas .
Rival cartels sparring for control of a plaza , the name given to any trafficking route , butcher each other and the security forces .
There is apparently no shortage of young , unemployed men willing to join the carnage .
Addressing the deep-seated social and economic problems of a city like Juárez , however , is a lot harder than flooding its streets with 8,000 soldiers carrying assault rifles .
Mexican President Felipe Calderón has , in this respect , remained faithful to the script written in previous theaters in the drug war , whether in Bolivia , Colombia , or Peru , where governments have used military force and extradition to placate the US and punish those with the least voice and influence .
But the language used by the Obama administration to describe the violence and state corruption that snakes from the Andes to the US border is starting to capture new thinking on narcotics .
Three former Latin American presidents , Mexico &apos;s second richest man , Ricardo Salinas , and the Supreme Court of Argentina , among others , have criticized the war on drugs as a manifest failure that has lowered street prices , fueled production , and undermined weak states .
More strikingly , both Bolivia and Ecuador are governed by presidents who suffered directly from the collateral insensitivities of the war on drugs .
Bolivia &apos;s Evo Morales rose to prominence as leader of the country &apos;s Coca growers during a brutal campaign to wipe out their crops , the so-called Dignity Plan .
Ecuadoran President Rafael Correa &apos;s father was jailed for smuggling drugs to the US when the future leader was five years old .
These leaders &quot; profound ambivalence toward the goal of a world free of illegal drugs is shared by the European Union , where restrictions on narcotics consumption have slackened over the past decade .
The past three US presidents , furthermore , have all admitted to consuming - to one extent or another - illegal psychoactive substances , while seven million Americans , according to the United Nations , are regular cocaine users .
But the inertia of a bureaucratic drug-enforcement superstructure ( worth approximately $ 40 billion each in the US and the EU ) , sustained by a deep-seated fear of the &quot; threat &quot; posed by drugs and cartels , appears to push policy repeatedly towards the familiar option of repressive auto-pilot .
For example , US support for Mexico &apos;s campaign against the cartels looks set in stone , with Congress apparently ready to provide $ 300 million for another year of military and security upgrading .
In Colombia , seven new joint military installations are planned , and support for US private contractors who have cornered the market in crop fumigation presumably will not be interrupted .
Nevertheless , as the flaws in the four-decade-old edifice of counter-narcotics become more visible , it is increasingly difficult to regard the risks of drug use as being greater than the damage done by repression .
Prohibition hikes the mark-up on prices - an astounding 15,000 % in the case of cocaine traveling to Europe from Andean processing facilities .
While the war on drugs focuses on bringing down cartels and their kingpins , it perversely aids the health of their markets , which Nestle within legitimate trade flows and respond to price incentives .
Interviewed by the Mexican magazine Proceso this year , the second-in-command of the giant Sinaloa cartel , Ismael Zambada , made the point clearly : &quot; The Narco problem involves millions of people .
How do you control it ?
The capos can be jailed , killed , or extradited , but their replacements are already wandering around . &quot;
The emergence of Latin America &apos;s powerful drug mafias cannot be traced to the radical evil of certain individuals .
These people emerged under conditions created in deeply inequitable societies by a misapplied , inconsistent , and bureaucratic war .
Indeed , the furies of the Zetas in Mexico originate in the counter-insurgency training provided in the 1990 &quot; s to a select group of special-forces soldiers , who later deserted .
The Zetas &quot; star recruits in recent years have come from the Guatemalan military &apos;s special forces , whose infamous induction technique involved biting off the head of a live chicken .
Meanwhile , in Jamaica and across the rural outposts of Central America , drug lords have become benefactors and heroes to the poor .
It is time for serious reconsideration of the status and regulation of illegal drugs , pointing to selective legalization , as well as reclassification of the market as a public-health , rather than a criminal , concern .
For now , policymakers across the Americas are tiptoeing towards the obvious .
A Dutch Treat for Brazil ?
Brazil &apos;s successful return to the financial markets at the end of April and the strengthening of the country &apos;s currency , the real , have shown that the election of President Luiz Inácio da Silva ( Lula ) has not led to a collapse of foreign confidence .
But nor do recent positive developments eliminate the need for structural economic reforms .
Lula recognizes that progress in this area , including labor market reform , is critical if Brazil is to grow sufficiently to allow him to carry on his ambitious social agenda .
How Lula , a former metal worker and founder of CUT , which also represents most automobile workers , manages relations with the trade unions will be critical .
Recent strikes by car workers at General Motors , Renault , Volvo , and Ford factories in Brazil do not augur well .
Proposed social security and tax reforms , presented to Congress at the end of April , seem to be creating additional tension .
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; Lula should look to Europe for examples of how to achieve high rates of growth and job creation yet maintain social protection .
Europe also can provide a roadmap for politicians determined to move from being anti-market left-wingers in opposition to reform-minded statesmen holding power .
Spain &apos;s Felipe González and Britain &apos;s Tony Blair both made that journey .
But a better example may be Wim Kok , who stepped down last year after eight years as Dutch Prime Minister .
Both Lula and Kok share the unusual distinction of becoming heads of government after serving as trade union leaders .
Upon reaching the top of the fnv , Holland &apos;s largest trade union , Kok found himself in a position of considerable influence in Dutch economic policymaking .
During his tenure as a union leader in the late 1970s and early 1980s , the Dutch economy experienced prolonged malaise--stagnant growth , high unemployment , prohibitive interest rates , and low corporate profitability .
Large fiscal deficits crowded out private investment .
Holland &apos;s problems were mainly structural , although a cyclical economic downturn made matters worse .
By 1982 , the situation had deteriorated to the point that the &quot; social partners &quot; in the Dutch tripartite system ( government , business , and trade unions ) concluded that combating the crisis required a break with the past .
The defining moment came with the Wassenaar agreement of that year--a pact between employers and trade unions , reached with the active encouragement of government .
Trade unions agreed to moderate wage claims and abandon wage indexation , in exchange for reduced working time and improved prospects for the future .
The increased flexibility of the Dutch labor market eventually restored private-sector profitability and led to rapid job creation , among the highest in Europe and comparable to the rate in the US .
A prudent fiscal stance , pursued while the economy recovered and interest rates fell , created room for big cuts in taxes and social contributions .
With lower inflation , this raised workers &apos; real disposable income , enabling trade union leaders to demonstrate to their members that wage moderation worked and was in their interest .
The recent , much weaker , performance of the Dutch economy is largely explained by strong wage increases , which undermined competitiveness and contributed to job extinction .
This prompted Kok to call last year--on the 20th anniversary of the Wassenaar accord--for a new pact among the country &apos;s social partners .
He will soon have a European-wide platform to deliver his message of wage moderation and labor-market flexibility through his assignment to breathe new life into the EU employment strategy .
How is the Wassenaar model relevant to Brazil ?
Not unlike Holland in the early 1980s , Brazil &apos;s economy today faces the challenge of stimulating rapid employment growth amid fiscal constraints and high interest rates .
While Brazil &apos;s registered unemployment rate is not very high by regional standards , its fast growing labor force requires a high rate of job creation .
Emulating the Dutch experience with job creation provides the surest possible path to alleviating poverty in Brazil .
The idea is not that Brazil should seek to implement the Dutch social-economic model--the countries are too different for that .
But Lula can and should follow Kok &apos;s example and use his trade union connections , as well as his rapport with the working class , to achieve a social pact aimed at achieving sustained improvement in Brazil &apos;s overall economic performance and realizing its potential to become Latin America &apos;s economic powerhouse .
Brazil has benefited from an improvement in market sentiment and financial indicators since Lula &apos;s election .
Now its government should encourage a Wassenaar-style guarantee of social peace .
This would give the authorities room to address the country &apos;s daunting longer-term policy agenda--including a major reform of the costly pension system , an overhaul of the tax system , and strengthening the bankruptcy framework--that Brazil must face in order to boost competitiveness .
Lula &apos;s countrymen , who elected him overwhelmingly , need rapid economic growth and job creation .
That will happen only if Lula completes a successful transformation from anti-market trade union leader into a statesman judiciously blending economic and social reform .
Success would benefit not only Brazil , but have a strong demonstration effect across Latin America .
A Europe for All
Longtime members of the European Union now seem to doubt the Union &apos;s future , but we in Ukraine look at the European Union with hope and admiration .
To join in the EU &apos;s progress is the basic object of our foreign policy , for Ukraine has discovered that nationhood is not an end , but a beginning .
Indeed , European unity is indivisible : When one nation is ostracized , all are not free .
We Europeans are caught in an inescapable net , tied in a single garment of destiny .
Every aspect of our shared culture , if not the last century of shared suffering , confirms that for us .
Whatever affects one European directly , affects all indirectly .
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; Never again can we afford to live with the narrow notion of two Europes , of haves and have-nots , of insiders and outsiders .
Anyone who lives within the European continent cannot - indeed , must not - be considered a stranger to its Union .
Today &apos;s great pax Europa and today &apos;s pan-European prosperity depend on this .
Of course , some people mutter that Ukraine is not Europe .
Let them come to Kyiv and speak to the people , young and old , factory worker , farmer &apos;s wife , the lawyers and doctors and teachers who stood and stayed in the cold and snow for weeks on end last winter to defend their freedoms .
Are they not united with those who stood alongside General de Gaulle in the French Resistance ?
Are they not one with those who died fighting for the Spanish Republic in the 1930 &quot; s , who liberated Budapest in 1956 and ended fascism in Spain and Portugal in the 1970 &quot; s ?
Are they not animated by the same spirit as Poland &apos;s Solidarity and the peaceful masses that created Prague &apos;s Velvet Revolution in 1989 ?
That is the true European spirit , and no doubts can crush it .
To those who say that Ukraine is too backward for EU membership , I say : Let them , too , come to my country and see the mothers who stay late at night at work teaching their children to use their workplace computer .
Let them come to the language classes in every village and city where young people are readying themselves for Europe by learning French and German and English.Those who doubt Ukraine &apos;s European vocation should understand that Europe is not a matter of hardware and superhighways ; it is the unquenchable desire for freedom , prosperity , and solidarity .
I believe that our future is as promising as Europe &apos;s past is proud , and that our destiny lies not as a forgotten Borderland on a troubled region , but as a maker and shaper of Europe &apos;s peace and Europe &apos;s unity .
Self-determination no longer means isolation , because achieving national independence nowadays means only to return to the world scene with a new status .
New nations can build with their former occupiers the same kind of fruitful relationship that France established with Germany - a relationship founded on equality and mutual interests .
That is the type of relationship that my government seeks with Russia , and achieving it is how we can help extend the zone of Europe &apos;s peace .
Of course , it is premature to do more than indicate the high regard with which we view the prospect of EU membership .
We know that our part in that great edifice will not be built overnight .
We know that the great works of European unification lay not in documents and declarations , but in innovative action designed to better the lives and insure the security of all Europeans .
Building a Ukraine worthy of EU membership will not be easy , cheap , or fast .
But , like the Union itself , it will be built and it will be done .
We know the challenge is great , but the prize is worth the struggle , and Europe should know that this is our goal .
Part of the work of renewing Ukraine is a creative battle to put an end to a nightmarish century during which fascism and communism - ideologies born in the heart of Europe - battled for mastery .
Only a few months ago , in cities throughout Ukraine , our children and our parents confronted armed troops , snarling dogs , and even death .
Only a few years ago , a young journalist , Georgi Gongadze , seeking to inform the public about our old regime &apos;s corruption , was brutalized and beheaded by that regime &apos;s thugs .
But our Orange Revolution last winter shows that Ukraine &apos;s people prevailed .
So , despite today &apos;s doubts and difficulties , I retain an abiding faith in Europe .
I refuse to accept despair as the final response to the ambiguities and horrors of Ukraine &apos;s history .
I refuse to accept the view that Ukraine is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of communism &apos;s legacy that we can never see the bright Daybreak of peace and true European unity .
When the EU &apos;s citizens ponder Ukraine &apos;s place in Europe , they should look both beyond and more closely at the face they see .
They should look beyond the ravaged wastelands that communism inflicted , beyond the poverty , and beyond the social divisions through which our discarded ex-leaders sought to prolong their misrule .
Instead , they should look closely at the face of our president , Viktor Yushchenko , ravaged by poison during last year &apos;s election campaign , and recall the words of the great Frenchman André Malraux , for whom &quot; the most beautiful faces are those that have been wounded . &quot;
A Europe of Judges
MAYNOOTH , IRELAND - As the Greek financial drama reaches its sorry dénouement , another crisis looms for the European project - this time in Germany , beginning with a case now before Germany &apos;s Constitutional Court .
Away from the rarefied atmosphere of EU summits ( which , so far , have been shaping the Union &apos;s response to events in Greece ) , other institutional actors have been - and are - shaping the EU system .
In particular , courts have driven European integration forward as much as politicians have .
The powerful European Court of Justice ( ECJ ) , in particular , has frequently been criticized for using European law to disguise an integrationist agenda .
Without the ECJ &apos;s doctrines of &quot; direct effect &quot; and &quot; primacy , &quot; and without national courts that are willing to enforce these doctrines in their own jurisdictions , the EU most likely would not have attained the level of integration that it has .
National courts may consider the effects of European integration on their constitutional and democratic institutions , affirming or rejecting the integration that has already taken place , or setting limits to supranational arrangements that might further impinge on national sovereignty .
This is significant , because , in May 2010 , a group of prominent German economists , led by Joachim Starbatty , commenced litigation before the German Constitutional Court in which they argued that the EU &apos;s assistance to Greece and Europe &apos;s new financial rescue fund violated Article 125 , the EU treaty &apos;s so-called &quot; no bailout &quot; clause .
The Court will begin hearing the case on July 5 .
Germany &apos;s Constitutional Court has been among the most prominent in declaring what it considers to be the appropriate limits to EU integration , consistent with the country &apos;s Basic Law ( constitution ) .
In a number of landmark judgments , the Court has expressed skepticism about any move toward a federal EU .
In 1993 , when ruling on the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty , the judges expressed clear reservations about the direction of the European integration process .
Their main argument was that the shortcomings of EU-level democratic practices required the German Bundestag to retain a substantial number of policy competences .
For the same reason , the competence to decide upon the further allocation of competences had to remain a prerogative of the German state and could not be transferred to the EU .
Crucially , the Court also asserted its authority to invalidate European laws if found by the judges to lack a basis in the European treaties .
In another landmark ruling in June 2009 , the Court made Germany &apos;s ratification of the Lisbon Treaty conditional upon the passage of new legislation giving the Bundestag enhanced powers of scrutiny over European affairs .
The Court relied on the same constitutional doctrines and conceptions of sovereignty elaborated in its Maastricht judgment .
Now the court in Karlsruhe will have to determine whether the EU &apos;s recently agreed European Stability Mechanism ( esm ) is consistent with the Basic Law .
The risk that the judges could rule the esm illegal played no small part in efforts made in recent months by Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Nicolas Sarkozy to bind the EU to a revised and more intrusive economic governance framework , effected through an amendment to the existing treaties .
The debate on sovereignty in Germany and other EU member states has been re-ignited not just by the debt crisis , but also by a string of controversial rulings by the ECJ , most notably the Court &apos;s interpretation of the freedoms of establishment and service delivery articulated in its Viking , Laval , and Ruffert decisions .
The discontent within Germany with the cumulative impact of these decisions has been expressed publicly by some of the country &apos;s most trusted public representatives .
In September 2008 , for example , former President Roman Herzog published a polemic entitled &quot; Stop the ECJ ! &quot; He accused the Luxembourg judges of grabbing ever-greater competences at the expense of the member states and urged the Constitutional Court to invalidate several controversial ECJ rulings .
Herzog &apos;s broadside resonated across Europe , where for some time there has been considerable disquiet about &quot; judicial activism &quot; and what some see as an irreversible trend toward empowerment of the ECJ and other EU institutions .
In many member states , the ECJ &apos;s decisions have produced a backlash , especially on the left , with trade unions and social movements targeting the Court &apos;s alleged zeal in siding with business over workers interests .
Such arguments were deployed successfully during the 2005 referenda on the Constitutional Treaty in France and the Netherlands , and in Ireland during the referendum on the Lisbon Treaty .
Indeed , the threat to the EU legal order does not lie solely with the German Constitutional Court .
In Ireland , an embattled austerity-driven coalition government might well have no choice but to hold a referendum on the European Stability Mechanism .
It is almost certain that Euro-skeptic groups will ask the Irish Supreme Court to rule on the constitutionality of the esm .
The Irish government has stated emphatically that any amendments to the Lisbon Treaty connected to eurozone reforms will not require a referendum .
Its reasoning seems to be that the proposed changes fall far short of what the Supreme Court &apos;s case law demands , and that the esm does not alter the EU &apos;s essential scope or objectives .
If the Irish Supreme Court were to decide that the esm requires popular consent , the EU would be faced with the prospect of yet another Irish referendum on Europe .
Thus , Ireland might yet play as significant a part as Germany in determining the future of any amendments to the EU constitutional order , with each country &apos;s top court playing as important a role as politicians in shaping Europe &apos;s future .
A Europe of Provinces , Not States
As the European Constitutional Convention assembles to debate the fine points of the European Union &apos;s future institutions , now is the moment to think the unthinkable about where Europe is heading .
Or at least , to consider perhaps a quite different question : Where would it be reasonable for the EU to move ?
Communism &apos;s fall saw the appearance of several small states in Europe .
Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania reemerged from Soviet occupation .
Czechoslovakia split into two separate states .
Yugoslavia gave way to Slovenia , Croatia , Bosnia , Serbia , Macedonia ; it may perhaps shortly disgorge Kosovo and Montenegro as well .
Although the Baltic republics merely reestablished their pre-WWII independence , and Yugoslavia &apos;s breakup was a bloody affair like so many other wars of independence , there is something tantalizing new in all this as well .
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; In the interwar years , the Baltic states were often viewed as impractical , artificial creations of the Great Powers .
Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia came into existence because their constituent parts were not seen as viable independent states .
Why was this ?
Because 80 years ago , when Wilson , Clemenceau , and Lloyd George redrew the map of Europe , small states were dysfunctional in times of both war and peace .
To be viable , a state needed to be large enough to defend itself and to constitute a relatively self-contained economic market .
None of this holds true today .
With the prospect of entry into the EU , national markets matter less .
Both EU and NATO membership make war among European member states unthinkable , and an attack on even the smallest NATO member would bring a response from all NATO members .
Lacking such external threats , the ties between , say , Czechs and Slovaks ( to say nothing of Serbs and Croats ! ) are too weak to warrant a common national level of government .
Does this tell us something about the future of Europe as a whole ?
The difference between Czechoslovakia and Italy or Germany is mostly one of 50 years .
After all , wasn &apos;t Italy , until 1860s , a collection of kingdoms and principalities ?
Wasn &apos;t Germany &apos;s unification a matter of &quot; blood and iron &quot; ?
France and Spain are older , but is the marriage of Basques , Catalans , and Corsicans with their national states that much happier than the former Czech / Slovak marriage ?
Is there really that much reason why the Scots and Welsh should be part of the same national state as the English ?
Abstract for a second from the idea of French or German or Italian identity , patriotism , the collective memories of war and carnage that cemented the consciousness of today &apos;s linguistic communities and think of this : Why do Europeans need an intermediate level of government , between the common European framework and their local institutions ?
Why do Piemontese , Bavarians , or Scots need intermediate national bureaucracies to run their tax policies , welfare programs , securities laws , and the largely useless , duplicative armies ?
Wouldn &apos;t life be easier if a common market , currency , foreign policy , army , and a few other things were run on a Europe-wide basis , with the rest left to more meaningful local units ?
It is fashionable to mock the bureaucratic minutia of European regulation .
But European regulation is as nothing compared to the mountains of national laws and decrees , billions wasted in political patronage , and the colossal state machines that eat up 30-40 % of the economic product of Europe &apos;s nation states .
Could any common European state do worse ?
Indeed , the creation of a European federal government and the elimination of national intermediaries would probably lead to the greatest liberalization of the economy ( and society as a whole ) in Europe &apos;s entire history .
Look at America in 1787 : Creation of the federal government swept away the balkanized system of pre-revolutionary colonies , ushering in an era of entrepreneurial expansion across the entire American Continent .
The simple fact is that Europe as a whole is too diverse to be captured by the economic and political interest groups that now dominate national states .
It is only as anadditional level of government that the EU appears onerous and bureaucratic .
If it were todisplace national governments , its burden would be weightless in comparison to what exists today .
Nations also put Europe &apos;s constitutional balance out of kilter .
Germany and Italy are simply too big , as compared to Portugal or Belgium ( itself a rather questionable amalgam of the Flemish and the Walloons ) , and this creates the types of imbalances reminiscent of the heavy foot of Prussia in the old Bismarckian empire .
Could a federal Europe replace today &apos;s national identities ?
Could the French and the British feel as spiritually at home in &quot; Europe &quot; as they feel in their national states ?
No , but must they ?
When Europeans think of future institutions , the tension is always seen as that between national differences and the common European identity .
But what if common European institutions are not viewed through the prism of national institutions ?
What if the evolution of European consciousness proceeds not by an upward transfer of attachment to supranational institutions , but by adevolution of loyalties , and a revival of smaller , more meaningful , communities ?
Of course , the demise of national states is not imminent , but not because they are so deeply rooted in the consciousness of their citizens .
Indeed , national identities are mostly impoverishing abstractions , clichés , like race , class , and other ideological creations .
Think of how much more genuine diversity would there be in a united Europe if national states did not squat in the middle .
But Europe &apos;s nation states are not going to disappear for a while because they arecenters of power .
After all , forty cents out of every euro of GDP is a lot to fight about .
If , however , Europeans gain a sense of where they should be going , perhaps in time the national identities forged in the last couple of hundred years ( for they are not much older than that ) will become like the appendix - a part of the human body responsible for little else but an occasional inflammation .
A European Opening for the Arab World
Berlin - The people of Tunisia and Egypt have shown that democracy in Arab countries need not come at the barrel of a Western gun .
But , while the drive for democratic change has been local and authentic , there is no guarantee of a successful political transition : Democratically elected governments will have to address the same social and economic problems that contributed to the old regimes &quot; fall - not least the need to create jobs and opportunities for the young .
This will be impossible without external support . Given the myriad links between the European Union countries and the Mediterranean &apos;s southern rim , Europe must not miss this opportunity .
So far , the EU has offered to support democratization in Tunisia and Egypt by helping to organize free and fair elections , establish political parties , and reform the police , courts , and local administrations .
But such political-administrative support is not enough . Nor is a Marshall Plan-type program of grand investments sufficient .
This is not to discount the need for such projects ; the renewable-energy sector , in particular , holds enormous opportunities for cooperation .
Europe needs clean energy , and will not be able to produce enough on its own territory .
The countries of North Africa also need energy - particularly more electricity and new networks to support urban and industrial development .
Indeed , the availability of uninterrupted electricity often makes the difference between , say , a Shoemaker &apos;s workshop and a shoe factory . And these countries have the most suitable environment for solar thermal power production .
According to some optimistic studies , solar thermal power plants and wind farms in North Africa could not only boost economic growth there , but also provide more than 15 % of Europe &apos;s electricity by 2050 .
Obviously , cooperation agreements and private investment in this sector should be encouraged .
The problem is that such long-term investments bring results only in the medium and long term .
They do not address today &apos;s social or economic problems , nor do they signal a new society-oriented approach by Europe towards its Mediterranean neighbors .
New EU programs should mainly aim at strengthening the specific capacities of Tunisia , Egypt , and others , and seek opportunities that benefit both sides of the Mediterranean .
Catherine Ashton , the EU &apos;s vice-president and high representative for foreign affairs and security policy , has proposed a Partnership for Democracy and Shared Prosperity with the Southern Mediterranean , which contains a host of useful measures , including facilitation of visas for students , academics , and business people .
But , to make this scheme more concrete , I would suggest augmenting it with a &quot; pact for labor and skills &quot; between the EU and the Arab countries that choose a path to democratic transformation .
Europe , while afraid of illegal migration , needs foreign labor for its own demographic reasons - not least young engineers , technical staff , doctors , and health-care workers .
Tunisia , Egypt , and the other Southern Mediterranean countries have an abundance of young people with degrees and no jobs , who often also need to acquire practical skills .
This is most urgent for the Arab world &apos;s baby boomers - those between 20 and 35 .
The next generation is already smaller .
As a practical step , the EU and its member states should offer 30,000 visas and work permits annually for graduates from participating Mediterranean countries .
Such a program would include , first , a traineeship in European firms , followed by the opportunity to work in Europe for 5-8 years .
At the end of that period , participants would receive soft business-startup loans from European development banks to create employment in their countries of origin .
Designed for at least a 15-year period , such a program would be a strong signal in itself .
It would show young people from Tunisia , Egypt , and other transformation countries that there are other options than getting on a boat to the Italian island of Lampedusa .
It would be a real incentive to finish one &apos;s university education ( indeed , it should be augmented by investment in vocational schools , technical high-schools , and universities in North Africa and the Middle East ) .
Once implemented , the labor pact would help to change attitudes towards Arab immigrants in Europe - and Europe &apos;s image in the Southern Mediterranean .
It would likely create lasting ties between people and economies .
And it would address real needs in the Southern Mediterranean countries - improving professional skills , reducing the pressure on the local labor market , creating businesses and jobs - as well as in Europe .
Some warn against any programs for &quot; temporary &quot; or &quot; circular &quot; migration .
To be sure , some who benefit would want to stay .
But , while this &quot; burden &quot; might , in fact , benefit aging European countries , the risk is relatively low in the first place : Arab countries entering such a pact would be better governed than they were under the previous regimes .
If they become consolidated democracies , as hoped , would-be entrepreneurs could stop worrying so much about official corruption .
And start-up loans from Europe would make it much easier to seek one &apos;s fortune back home .
Such an approach needs to be communicated both to the European public and to the people of Tunisia , Egypt , and other Arab countries .
It would reverse the pattern whereby Europe relies on repressive regimes to supply it with oil and gas and guard its borders against migrants .
At long last , these countries &quot; demographic wealth would be used to meet their development needs .
Closing Europe &apos;s Strategy Gap
Madrid - The ongoing crisis in Ukraine has been a hot topic of analysis for almost a year .
But one question has largely escaped thorough examination : What Russia &apos;s annexation of Crimea and invasion of eastern Ukraine indicates about the European Union &apos;s foreign policy .
During the early stages of the crisis , Germany , which had bet heavily on Russia &apos;s modernization , was averse to taking any consequential action .
But , as the crisis deepened , German Chancellor Angela Merkel worked to persuade her European counterparts to implement a broad and biting sanctions regime .
This certainly was a step in the right direction , but it did nothing to address the foreign-policy failings that helped spark the Ukrainian crisis and continue to undermine Europe &apos;s response - namely , the EU &apos;s misguided Neighborhood Policy ( ENP ) and its muddled approach to energy .
On both of these fronts , the EU &apos;s lack of strategic vision has created the impression that Europe is repeatedly being outmaneuvered by Russian President Vladimir Putin .
It increasingly appears that Ukraine is becoming locked in a &quot; frozen conflict &quot; - Russia &apos;s foreign-policy specialty .
Indeed , the situation in Ukraine represents a tactical victory for Russia , with the fragile but enduring ceasefire - and accompanying legislation that grants Donetsk and Luhansk considerable political autonomy - allowing Russia to entrench the conflict near the EU &apos;s border .
Moreover , the delayed implementation of key elements of the EU &apos;s association agreement with Ukraine is clear evidence that , at the moment , Russia dictates the terms of EU-Ukrainian engagement .
In Europe , the Kremlin has been able to pursue a successful divide-and-rule strategy , particularly in view of Hungary &apos;s decision to suspend gas flows to Ukraine .
Prime Minister Viktor Orbán &apos;s government , whose behavior in recent years has been at odds with the EU &apos;s criteria for democracy , now openly approves of authoritarian regimes - and Putin &apos;s , in particular - with serious potential consequences for European unity .
Nonetheless , the timing of the current ceasefire , which coincides with the installation of a new EU Commission , is advantageous , as is Putin &apos;s shortsighted emphasis on tactical victories .
EU leaders should take advantage of the break in the fighting to stop reacting and start anticipating .
With a long-term strategic vision , the EU could overwhelm and ultimately undermine Putin &apos;s short-term successes .
Such a vision must include a reconceptualization of the ENP .
The program &apos;s mission - to help guide the political , social , and economic transitions of neighboring states - is not inherently problematic ; the problem lies in the way that the mission has been interpreted and pursued .
For starters , the ENP assumes that all of the EU &apos;s neighbors , both in the south and in the east , ultimately want to realize European values and structures in their own countries .
In other words , the ENP does not account for the developmental , cultural , and aspirational differences among the EU &apos;s partner countries .
The ENP suffers operationally from its excessively technical approach and lack of strategic vision .
For example , before the Ukraine crisis , the European Commission was so focused on negotiating the technical features of the association agreement that it did not consider adequately the potential fallout of the process - such as , say , a response from Russia .
To be sure , the EU recognized its need for a coherent strategy , and attempted to resolve it by establishing the European External Action Service and the position of High Representative for Foreign Affairs .
But the EEAS ended up in a turf war with the European Commission , and outgoing High Representative Catherine Ashton did little to ease the tension , owing to her unwillingness to involve herself in intra-EU disagreements .
It is telling that Ashton has made progress exclusively in areas defined by ample consensus , such as the negotiations on Iran &apos;s nuclear program and the pact between Kosovo and Serbia .
Further eroding Europe &apos;s effectiveness is its fragmented approach to securing energy supplies .
With every country largely controlling its own energy policy , Europe &apos;s energy market has become inefficient and excessively dependent on Russian supplies .
To the extent that there has been an EU-wide energy strategy , it has related to renewables , rather than the intersection of Geopolitics and energy security .
But there is reason for hope .
The new Commission , which its president , Jean Claude Juncker , has restructured significantly , could provide Europe with the strategic leadership it so badly needs .
In fact , Juncker has already expressed a desire to integrate incoming High Representative Federica Mogherini into the Commission &apos;s policy program .
The new structure - which tasks Mogherini with guiding and coordinating the work of multiple commissioners , including those responsible for trade , the ENP , and climate and energy - should strengthen the coherence and direction of EU policies , particularly after Mogherini completes her European Council-mandated assessment of the global strategic landscape .
But a restructured Commission is not enough to ensure a reset of Europe &apos;s foreign-policy strategy .
For that to happen , Mogherini must assert herself as a leader , backed by Juncker and the new European Council president , Donald Tusk .
And , most important , all EU member states must recommit themselves to cooperation .
The Ukrainian people have demonstrated the power of Europe &apos;s values .
Indeed , Europe has a large set of tools at its disposal ; it just needs to figure out how to use them .
If it can , it will be better able to respond not only to the Russian challenge , but also to many of the other challenges that characterize today &apos;s rapidly shifting global environment .
A Fair Deal for Africa &apos;s Resources
Windhoek - Namibia is a resource-based economy that has embarked on an ambitious development program .
Our vision is to turn Namibia into a knowledge-based , diversified economy by 2030 .
One of the major principles upon which this vision is based is the idea of &quot; partnerships &quot; - a major prerequisite for the achievement of dynamic , efficient , and sustainable development .
Partnerships between governments and foreign investors are at the core of the sound management of natural resources .
But such partnerships can &apos;t be taken for granted on a continent where the quest for natural resources has fueled decades of violent conflict .
Genuine partnership is difficult to achieve when resource-rich countries view foreign mining and drilling companies only as adversaries , seeking unfair and inequitable contracting agreements .
From the perspective of companies , partnership is unattractive when they are forced to incur large losses owing to project disruptions and contract renegotiations .
By contrast , partnerships are strengthened if companies and governments recognize their shared interest in durable , mutually beneficial contracts that ensure stable revenue streams from projects .
This requires a framework that takes into account , among other things , developmental possibilities , environmental concerns , labor conditions , and community interests , and that is adaptable to changing circumstances .
For governments , contracts are more likely to be durable if they are negotiated in a way that enables countries to receive fair and predictable long-term revenues .
For developing countries , this source of income can be substantial over several decades , and is needed by governments for investment in infrastructure , health care , education , etc .
On the other hand , poorly conceived and negotiated contracts not only prevent countries from enjoying the full long-term benefits of their natural resources , but also help to entrench poverty , corruption , and even conflict , particularly when governance systems are inadequate .
For companies , contracts are more likely to be durable if they are negotiated in a way that continuously rewards firms for risky and capital-intensive investment in terms of the net present value of their earnings .
Companies also want , of course , contracts that won &apos;t be repudiated by the next government .
Indeed , poorly negotiated contracts are a recipe for adverse business outcomes , such as reduced security of mining titles , increased likelihood of operational disruptions from targeted civil protests , and greater risk of revisions to tax and other conditions .
Many governments in Africa simply don &apos;t have the capacity to negotiate complex contracts that require a wide range of in-depth knowledge of law , finance , geology , economic modeling , etc . , while firms typically do .
As a result , the contracts that are negotiated often do not meet the criteria described above - to the disadvantage not only of governments , but also of firms interested in durable contracts .
In the absence of conditions for equitable negotiations , governments often deem the resulting contracts unfair - thus dooming them to be breached at some point .
In these circumstances , there is an urgent need for a facility that allows governments of poor countries to negotiate on a par with foreign investors to reach contracts that are as fair as possible under the given circumstances .
The outcome of such negotiations can be expected to be - and to be perceived to be - more balanced , more transparent , more stable , and therefore more sustainable .
The time has come to establish such a facility - in the interest of a mutually beneficial partnership between governments and foreign investors .
A Fair Deal for Turkey
Turkey has been given what looks like an ultimatum from the EU Commission : Open your ports for ships from Cyprus within a month , or you may risk a halt to the EU accession talks now underway .
At the same time , the Commission &apos;s latest report on Turkey &apos;s progress toward accession notes that political reforms have slowed down , further calling into question the country &apos;s future EU membership .
The Commission &apos;s progress report will be dealt with by the European Council next month . At that meeting , European leaders should ask themselves the following questions : Has the EU given Turkey a fair deal in the case of Cyprus ?
Has the EU &apos;s behavior been consistent in supporting political reform in Turkey ?
What are the EU &apos;s long-term interests vis-à-vis Turkey ?
If the answers to the first two questions are &quot; no &quot; - as I believe they are - the third question becomes vitally important .
True , Turkey has closed its ports to ships from ( Greek ) Cyprus , and this is a violation of agreements .
But it is also true that the northern Turkish part of Cyprus is denied access to free trade and other benefits from EU-membership .
This is because Cyprus remains a divided island .
It was assumed that Cyprus should be united when the country joined the EU in 2004 .
A United Nations plan for unification was accepted by the Turkish part . But the Greek Cypriots voted against the plan because their leaders did not live up to the implicit deal with the EU to support it .
Nevertheless , Cyprus became an EU member - but only the Greek part .
This was clearly a mistake , because it made the EU part of the conflict . It gave Greek Cypriot leaders the possibility of blocking progress in negotiations between the EU and Turkey .
So how can Turkey under these conditions maintain confidence in the EU &apos;s fairness ?
Political and legal reforms in Turkey in recent years have been remarkably far-reaching , for they have clearly been spurred by Turks &quot; wish to move closer to the EU .
But Turkish public support for EU membership has fallen dramatically as Turks have grown to feel that they are not being given a fair deal .
This has given new strength to those who want Turkey to develop in another direction , towards a more Islamic society instead of a modern secular state .
Therefore , the recent lack of progress in Turkey &apos;s reform process can to a large extent be explained by the EU &apos;s behavior .
This leaves us with the third question : What kind of Turkey does the EU want ?
There should be no doubt about the answer : It is clearly in the EU &apos;s interest to see Turkey &apos;s democracy and economy continue to strengthen .
More than 40 years ago , it was promised that once Turkey lives up to the preconditions for membership , it will be welcome in the EU .
It is high time that European leaders take this promise seriously .
It is a sad fact that a large majority of voters in the EU are against Turkish membership . But they are reacting to the current situation .
When they are asked if they would like a reformed Turkey as a partner - a Turkey that lives up fully to the conditions for membership described in the Copenhagen Criteria ( democracy , rule of law , respect for human rights , and an effective market economy ) - many more are inclined to say yes .
European leaders must therefore take up two challenges .
First , they should say clearly to their own voters that the EU must live up to its promises to Turkey , and that this is in the larger interest of all Europeans .
Second , they should give Turkey a fair deal in the negotiations .
The first litmus test on European leadership concerns the practical problem of access to harbors .
Here the Finns , who chair the EU right now , have taken an initiative to implement a pragmatic solution that takes into consideration both sides in the conflict .
The Finnish initiative should be given strong support from all European leaders .
At the same time , a new effort should be made to bring life to the UN &apos;s proposals regarding Cyprus .
If this means putting pressure on some actors within the EU &apos;s own ranks , so be it .
A Farewell to ( Glorious ) War
In recent days , Italy &apos;s government fell after losing a parliamentary vote on the country &apos;s troop deployment in Afghanistan , while Britain and Denmark announced that they are to begin withdrawing their troops from Iraq .
Whereas the Bush administration is deploying an additional 21,000 American soldiers in Iraq , and is pushing for more allied troops in Afghanistan , America &apos;s allies are rejecting its Middle East policy .
They are increasingly convinced that &quot; victory &quot; will be elusive in any asymmetric conflict between states , however powerful , and religiously driven armed insurgents .
Donald Rumsfeld &apos;s dogma of military &quot; transformation &quot; - the technological upgrading of an army &apos;s capacity to enable decisive victory with fewer troops - failed resoundingly in Iraq .
Nor could Israel , with its overwhelming technological advantage , defeat Hezbollah in Lebanon .
More rockets and missiles fell on northern Israel in 33 days than hit Britain during all of World War II .
So the Israelis now must reckon with an entirely new phenomenon : An asymmetric entity , Hezbollah , with nation-state firepower .
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; So the fierce debate over whether to increase the size of American ground forces in Iraq is beside the point .
Neither the Soviet experience in Afghanistan in the 1980 &quot; s nor NATO &apos;s today vindicates the claim that troop numbers are what matter most on the modern battlefield .
When geo-strategic military front lines are non-existent , as in Kosovo , Afghanistan , and Iraq , mass no longer equals victory .
The great military thinker Carl von Clausewitz &apos;s notion of &quot; decisive battles &quot; as the &quot; center of gravity &quot; of war is simply irrelevant to conflicts that have no visible &quot; center of gravity . &quot;
Indeed , while wars from the time of Hannibal &apos;s defeat of the Romans in 216 B.C. to the Gulf War of 1991 had this center of gravity , with a massive concentration of force capable of bringing an enemy to its knees , such industrial inter-state wars have now become an historical anachronism .
Most states nowadays lie within borders that are widely accepted as legitimate , and they increasingly abide by international norms of behavior in times of war .
In fact , the obligation of states to abide by humanitarian rules of conduct while their enemies are free to barbarize warfare is what makes asymmetric wars especially insoluble .
Moreover , in an era of global media and international war crimes courts , the criteria for states &quot; use of military force have become more complex than ever .
Inter-state combat may still occur where strategic front lines can be found , such as Israel &apos;s border with Syria , India &apos;s border with Pakistan , and the border dividing the two Koreas .
In such cases , war , as the Egyptians showed in 1973 , might still serve as an avenue to resolving a conflict .
The Syrians might be tempted to launch an offensive against Israel with the objective of breaking the deadlock over the future of the Golan Heights .
However , in the case of Kashmir , the asymmetric conflict currently fought by proxies and terrorist groups might not degenerate into all-out war precisely because India and Pakistan have mutual nuclear deterrence.Indeed , such asymmetric conflicts through proxies have become the new conventional way that states avoid the price of a general war .
This changing nature of the battlefield essentially means that war as a conclusive event in an international conflict has become obsolete .
The facile Clausewitzian wisdom that military action ultimately leads to a political solution is no longer convincing .
&quot; Victory &quot; cannot bring peace , simply because there will always be a war after the war .
Thus , for example , the conventional war in Kosovo lasted for two months , only to usher in a six-year asymmetric conflict .
Likewise , America &apos;s three-week &quot; shock and awe &quot; campaign in Iraq in 2003 ended in &quot; victory , &quot; but opened the gates of hell for occupiers and ordinary Iraqis alike .
And six months after the merciless pounding of southern Lebanon , Hezbollah is as strong as it was before .
Nor does the return of the Taliban in Afghanistan six years after their overthrow now seen too far-fetched .
It is during the war after the war that the occupier &apos;s inferiority is revealed , with constant reinforcements increasing the number of targets for the insurgents far more quickly than the occupier can adapt to the changing battlefield .
The insurgents in Iraq , as the British admit , were able in just three years to cope with their enemies &quot; technological superiority in a way that the IRA in Northern Ireland was unable to do in 30 years .
The Iraq war and Israel &apos;s wars with Hamas and Hezbollah show the limits of what military power can achieve , as well as vindicate diplomacy and conflict resolution .
When it comes to tackling complex political and cultural conflicts , forging international and regional alliances around a legitimate objective is more important than sheer military capacity .
That said , it would be dangerously naïve to believe that the exercise of power and the capacity to intimidate are unnecessary .
But the objectives of the use of force need to be linked to the recognition that in today &apos;s asymmetric conflicts , victory is no longer achieved on the battlefield .
Only better-informed foreign policies that can address the genuine anxieties of civilizations in crisis will yield more sustainable results .
A Field Guide to Israeli Hawks
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon &apos;s announcement that he plans to dismantle Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip , as well as some settlements in the West Bank , has shocked and caught people off guard both in Israel and around the world .
Many denounced Sharon &apos;s plan as a trick .
But that surprise was wrong-headed from the start .
Despite the way it often looks to outsiders , debates in Israel about the future of the occupied territories have never been confined to hawks and doves .
Like everything in Israel , the process is more complicated , especially where the hawks are concerned .
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; Basically , there are two species of Israeli hawks : Call one kind ideological and the other strategic .
Ideological hawks view the occupied territories as an integral part of the historical Land of Israel , the homeland of the Jewish people .
For them , the territories are part of the Jewish patrimony , which is why they insist on referring to the West Bank by its Hebrew historical appellation - Judea and Samaria .
Not all ideological hawks are religious , although those who are base their claim on divine promises and prophecies .
But many ideological hawks are secular nationalists , and their jargon is similar to that of typical Central and Eastern European nationalists .
Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir belonged to that category .
Ideological hawks usually come from the National-Religious Party and from members of the Likud .
They are inspired by the nationalist ideology connected with Vladimir Jabotinsky , who founded &quot; Revisionist &quot; Zionism as a challenge to the more moderate version espoused by Israel &apos;s Founding Fathers like Chaim Weizmann and David Ben-Gurion .
Then there are the strategic hawks .
For them , given Israel &apos;s narrow and vulnerable geographic shape and continuing Arab enmity , controlling the West Bank and Gaza is not an ideological imperative , but is driven by security considerations .
For them , Jewish settlements in the territories are not a return to historical lands , but security outposts , aimed at preventing - or repelling from a better strategic position - an attack on the Israeli heartland .
They may be right or wrong in this assessment , but it is not an ideological one .
Ariel Sharon , who comes from a military background - he grew up in a social milieu much nearer to Labor than to Jabotinsky &apos;s ideas - is a strategic hawk .
For ideological hawks , compromises are treason : How can you jeopardize the historical patrimony of the Jewish people , let alone God &apos;s promise to Abraham ?
Strategic hawks , however , are open to practical bargains and compromises - if the circumstances are right and if the security considerations justify it in their eyes .
It is in this context that Sharon &apos;s moves should be seen .
He was elected on the promise that he would bring peace and security .
He has brought neither .
With the defeat and demise of Saddam Hussein , the danger of an &quot; Eastern front &quot; against Israel has diminished .
Absent a Palestinian partner , and given continuing Palestinian terrorism - which Israel &apos;s harsh responses fail to quell - what Sharon appears to be doing now follows from his strategic-oriented thinking : Set up an effective barrier , move some of the isolated and strategically untenable settlements , and wait for another day .
If one follows Sharon &apos;s statements in the last year , a clear pattern emerges .
First , he admitted that &quot; eventually &quot; a Palestinian state would emerge - something unthinkable for dyed-in-the-wool ideological hawks .
A few months later , he scandalized his own Likud party conference by stating that occupation is wrong and untenable - another shock for those who always speak of &quot; liberated &quot; rather than &quot; occupied &quot; territories .
Last December , he explicitly stated that Israel is headed towards unilateral disengagement , and that this would entail the &quot; relocation &quot; of some settlements .
Although this was still merely verbiage , it was novel language for a Likud prime minister .
Sharon &apos;s latest statements , though , explicitly specified the settlements to be evacuated ; the Director of the National Security Council , General Giora Eiland , was appointed to chair an inter-ministerial Relocation Committee and work out plans for conducting the evacuations , including compensation for relocated settlers .
All of this has radically altered Israel &apos;s domestic political map .
Some ideological hawks in Sharon &apos;s government threatened to resign ; Shimon Peres announced that Labor will offer Sharon a parliamentary safety net ; there is even talk about Labor joining a national unity government .
The test , of course , is not in the planning , but in the implementation of withdrawal , and the road is long and bumpy .
Sharon &apos;s timing may have been determined by his problems with police investigations into alleged corruption .
Yet anyone who would like to predict Sharon &apos;s future behavior should remember that unlike Begin and Shamir , Sharon comes from the military , and for him security - not ideology - is supreme .
So his apparent pragmatism should come as no surprise .
A Flat World and a Round Ball
With the final stage of the World Cup approaching , now is a good opportunity for a mid-tournament appraisal .
This year &apos;s Cup , unlike the previous one in Japan and South Korea in 2002 , didn &apos;t witness any real upsets in the first round .
Switzerland and Australia surprisingly reached the elimination round , and the Asian and African teams disappointed somewhat , with only Ghana advancing .
There have been just two ugly matches so far , full of fouls , nasty attacks , and unnecessary aggression , as well as numerous yellow and red cards : Italy vs. the US , and Portugal vs. the Netherlands .
Otherwise , we &apos;re experiencing a wonderful Cup in Germany , in terms of both sportsmanship and the overall atmosphere .
As for Germany and the Germans , one hardly recognizes one &apos;s own country and people .
Even Mother Nature has played along .
After a long winter and a non-existent spring , summer started promptly with the first kick-off - and virtually overnight , Germany has flaunted its sunniest and most delightful side .
The weather is Mediterranean , and all of a sudden , so are the people .
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; The Cup &apos;s organization has been exceptional ( as was to be expected ) , with excellent police work giving hooligans hardly a chance .
The whole of Germany has been celebrating a never-ending party with guests from all over the world ( which was not expected ) .
And the German team has put on a wonderful display of heart warming and modern offensive soccer ( which nobody could have expected ! ) .
More importantly , not only in the German team , but also in the country as a whole , a young , cool , laid-back , and carefree Germany is raising its head - a Germany that is cosmopolitan , friendly , and good-humored .
Years of bad news appear to have passed the Germans by without a trace .
Doctors are on strike , taxes are on the rise , the parties in government are mauling each other , and Chancellor Angela Merkel herself proclaimed in a prominent speech that the country is in disastrous shape .
But the Germans , Undaunted by it all , simply keep celebrating one great soccer party with their newfound friends from all over the world .
The black , red , and gold German tricolor adorns the entire country as never before , but almost nowhere are there nationalist undertones .
In fact , the flags of many nations fly alongside German .
In Berlin , as in other large German cities , taxis sport the flags of their drivers &quot; home countries - from Angola to Saudi Arabia .
Fans don not just their nations &quot; flags , but also fantastic costumes evocative of their home countries &quot; colors .
Flags are flown in hope of victory , but also serve to dry the tears of defeat .
In short , Germany during the World Cup is reminiscent of a Shakespearean midsummer night &apos;s dream , with a touch of Woodstock to boot .
Outside the stadiums , public screenings of the games have become joyous mass &quot; happenings . &quot;
And how is the soccer ?
This World Cup demonstrates three main developments that the sport has undergone .
First , Europe and South America are more dominant than four years ago and remain the unchallenged great powers of international soccer .
So we must hope that the World Cup in South Africa in 2010 will finally bring greater global parity .
Second , international soccer is witnessing the advent of a new generation .
Spain , Argentina , and Germany , to name but a few countries , have put forward very young teams that have played an impressive game .
On the French , English , and Portuguese teams , too , it is the young players that have shone - despite the continuing presence of Zidane , Beckham , and Figo .
Even the Brazilian squad is looking more aggressive and likely to score with young players like Robinho and Juninho than with their aging champions from 2002 .
This generational change is accelerated by a third development . At the top international level , soccer has become faster and more athletic , and the top teams can shrink space on the field more effectively .
A team that is unable to keep going at full speed for the full 90 ( or more ) minutes , switch from defense to offense quickly with the whole team , and maintain control of the ball to restrict their opponents &apos; movements won &apos;t stand much of a chance .
Here , soccer parallels today &apos;s globalized markets , which make similar restructuring of national economies necessary .
Unlike economic globalization , however , it remains to be seen whether this new , fast-paced style of soccer will prevail ( after all , the young blood of Spain lost to the Old Boys of France ) .
The sport and its fans will certainly profit if it does .
For now , we have a World Cup filled with soccer that is being shaped by a new , young generation both on and off the playing field - light-hearted , enthralling , and beautiful to watch .

Let &apos;s hope that when the last whistle blows at the final in Berlin on July 9 , we Germans retain as much of this positive spirit as possible .
Germany urgently needs this kind of optimism , because , unfortunately , two universal principles will continue to apply in the future : First , the winter will return , and , second , the ball is round and the next game is always the most difficult .
A Foreign Policy for New and Old Europe
Watching the news from Iraq , I recall when I was Poland &apos;s Prime Minister during the Gulf War in 1991 .
I watched from home on CNN as the first cruise missiles hit Baghdad .
Hours later our military informed me that armed conflict was underway in Iraq . &quot; Yes , I know , &quot; I said . &quot; I &apos;ve been watching the bombardment on TV . &quot;
Twelve years later , Poland &apos;s Prime Minister didn &apos;t need a belated call from his military to know that war was underway in Iraq .
All the details of the attack were provided in advance by the US , now Poland &apos;s NATO ally .
Indeed , Poland has secured a leading role in Iraq &apos;s occupation .
What a distance Poland has travelled since communism &apos;s collapse in 1989 !
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; Little of this , however , is the result of design , for ( unfortunately ) we in Poland have not thought through what sort of foreign policy we need as a member of NATO and putative member of the European Union .
We remain narrowly focussed on whether an initiative will be immediately good or bad for us .
Couple this with a form of foreign policy schizophrenia--some Poles think that by &quot; simply existing &quot; we influence Europe &apos;s fate ; others suffer crippling pessimism , consigning Poland to permanent &quot; second-class &quot; status--and you have a recipe for inertia .
Our attitude seems to be that somehow things will sort themselves out .

Much of Europe seems to be stuck in the same mindset : We say that we want a common foreign and security policy , but we do nothing about it until a crisis emerges . Then we squabble about what to do .
The time for such laxity is over .
For Poland and the other countries of East-Central Europe that have or are about to join NATO , membership in the Alliance didn &apos;t really require debate .
Our histories of oppression by powerful neighbours told us that collective security within NATO was theonlyreal option .
EU membership and the global war on terror , however , demand a more deeply considered response .
Why ?
Because EU membership affects every aspect of a state , economy , and society , while the war on terror demands a completely new way to conduct diplomacy and security policy .
Today &apos;s crisis in transatlantic relations , and our accidental involvement in it as part of Donald Rumsfeld &apos;s &quot; New Europe , &quot; means that Poland ( like every other European state ) must now decide what it really wants from the EU and NATO .
We must consider both our attitude to global problems that were once deemed peripheral to European interests , as well what it really means to be an EU partner .
Only answers to these questions can reconcile the divide between the &quot; new &quot; and &quot; old &quot; Europe , as well as the new and old Atlantic worlds .
Poland as an ally of the US is not the real headache facing President Jacques Chirac or Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder .
Instead , the French and German leaders are really responding to the growing unpredictability of today &apos;s emerging European order .
They see new players ( say , Spain ) rising to shape EU policy , particularly foreign policy , and sense that their traditional leadership is being challenged .
But an EU with 10 new members simply cannot be run as it has for decades .
So the challenge to France and Germany does not arise because Poland is some sort of American &quot; Trojan Horse . &quot; Instead , the EU &apos;s structure now demands not only a new consensus about Europe &apos;s role in the world , but also new means to achieve consensus .
History cannot be put on hold as Europe sorts out its internal balance of power .
The world needs a united continent , ready to go into action .
That consensus must include the US .
During the Cold War , most Europeans tolerated America &apos;s tendency to lead unilaterally , because of the Soviet threat and the preponderance of US power .
But America is having a hard time understanding the new circumstances of the post-Cold war era .
Its difficulties are exacerbated by the dramatic disparity in military forces on either side of the Atlantic , and its belief that Europe &apos;s ambitions to become a military power will come to nothing because Europeans won &apos;t spend the money necessary to achieve that goal .
Here is where Poland can help bridge the Atlantic divide and forge a European consensus .
September 1939 taught every Pole that military power must be real to be effective .
Intentions don &apos;t deter invasions .
As Danish Premier Anders Fogh Rasmussen recently said , &quot; France and Germany are not in a position to guarantee our country &apos;s security .
The US is , but security does not come free of charge . &quot;
Most Poles think that Poland &apos;s situation is akin to Denmark &apos;s .
Indeed , all of Europe is in thrall to American power .
But this dependence should not disguise the fact that there is a commonality of foreign policy interests between Europe and America .
If the EU builds its foreign and security policy on the basis of recognition of this truth , many of today &apos;s divisions will disappear .
The EU &apos;s foreign policy should be guided by the following goals :
Fight terrorism ;
Prevent local conflict ;
Promote human rights and democracy ;
Oblige unpredictable countries to become responsible ;
Maintain close cooperation between Europe and the US ;
Help poor countries .
Polish foreign policy , like that of the EU , can only be effective in the long term if it takes realistic steps--and spends the necessary money--to realize these objectives .
They are the only possible bedrock in transatlantic relations , in an expanded Union , and in relations between the &quot; New &quot; and &quot; Old &quot; Europe .
A Fracking Good Story
Prague - Weather conditions around the world this summer have provided ample fodder for the global warming debate .
Droughts and heat waves are a harbinger of our future , carbon cuts are needed now more than ever , and yet meaningful policies have not been enacted .
But , beyond this well-trodden battlefield , something amazing has happened : Carbon-dioxide emissions in the United States have dropped to their lowest level in 20 years .
Estimating on the basis of data from the US Energy Information Agency ( EIA ) from the first five months of 2012 , this year &apos;s expected CO2 emissions have declined by more than 800 million tons , or 14 % , from their peak in 2007 .
The cause is an unprecedented switch to natural gas , which emits 45 % less carbon per energy unit .
The US used to generate about half its electricity from coal , and roughly 20 % from gas .
Over the past five years , those numbers have changed , first slowly and now dramatically : In April of this year , coal &apos;s share in power generation plummeted to just 32 % , on par with gas .
America &apos;s rapid switch to natural gas is the result of three decades of technological innovation , particularly the development of hydraulic fracturing , or &quot; fracking , &quot; which has opened up large new resources of previously inaccessible shale gas .
Despite some legitimate concerns about safety , it is hard to overstate the overwhelming benefits .
For starters , fracking has caused gas prices to drop dramatically .
Adjusted for inflation , gas has not been this cheap for the past 35 years , with the price this year 3-5 times lower than it was in the mid-2000 &quot; s .
And , while a flagging economy may explain a small portion of the drop in US carbon emissions , the EIA emphasizes that the major explanation is natural gas .
The reduction is even more impressive when one considers that 57 million additional energy consumers were added to the US population over the past two decades .
Indeed , US carbon emissions have dropped some 20 % per capita , and are now at their lowest level since Dwight D. Eisenhower left the White House in 1961 .
David Victor , an energy expert at the University of California , San Diego , estimates that the shift from coal to natural gas has reduced US emissions by 400-500 megatonnes ( Mt ) of CO2 per year .
To put that number in perspective , it is about twice the total effect of the Kyoto Protocol on carbon emissions in the rest of the world , including the European Union .
It is tempting to believe that renewable energy sources are responsible for emissions reductions , but the numbers clearly say otherwise .
Accounting for a reduction of 50 Mt of CO2 per year , America &apos;s 30,000 wind turbines reduce emissions by just one-tenth the amount that natural gas does .
Biofuels reduce emissions by only ten Mt , and solar panels by a paltry three Mt .
This flies in the face of conventional thinking , which continues to claim that mandating carbon reductions - through cap-and-trade or a carbon tax - is the only way to combat climate change .
But , based on Europe &apos;s experience , such policies are precisely the wrong way to address global warming .
Since 1990 , the EU has heavily subsidized solar and wind energy at a cost of more than $ 20 billion annually .
Yet its per capita CO2 emissions have fallen by less than half of the reduction achieved in the US - even in percentage terms , the US is now doing better .
Because of broad European skepticism about fracking , there is no gas miracle in the EU , while the abundance of heavily subsidized renewables has caused over-achievement of the CO2 target .
Along with the closure of German nuclear power stations , this has led , ironically , to a resurgence of coal .
Well-meaning US politicians have likewise shown how not to tackle global warming with subsidies and tax breaks .
The relatively small reduction in emissions achieved through wind power costs more than $ 3.3 billion annually , and far smaller reductions from ethanol ( biofuels ) and solar panels cost at least $ 8.5 and $ 3 billion annually .
Estimates suggest that using carbon taxes to achieve a further 330 Mt CO2 reduction in the EU would cost $ 250 billion per year .
Meanwhile , the fracking Bonanza in the US not only delivers a much greater reduction for free , but also creates long-term social benefits through lower energy costs .
The amazing truth is that fracking has succeeded where Kyoto and carbon taxes have failed .
As shown in a study by the Breakthrough Institute , fracking was built on substantial government investment in technological innovation for three decades .
Climate economists repeatedly have pointed out that such energy innovation is the most effective climate solution , because it is the surest way to drive the price of future green energy sources below that of fossil fuels .
By contrast , subsidizing current , ineffective solar power or ethanol mostly wastes money while benefiting special interests .
Fracking is not a panacea , but it really is by far this decade &apos;s best green-energy option .
A Free Lunch for America
Berkeley - Former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers had a good line at the International Monetary Fund meetings this year : Governments , he said , are trying to treat a broken ankle when the patient is facing organ failure .
Summers was criticizing Europe &apos;s focus on the second-order issue of Greece while far graver imbalances - between the EU &apos;s north and south , and between reckless banks &quot; creditors and governments that failed to regulate properly - worsen with each passing day .
But , on the other side of the Atlantic , Americans have no reason to feel smug .
Summers could have used the same metaphor to criticize the United States , where the continued focus on the long-run funding dilemmas of social insurance is sucking all of the oxygen out of efforts to deal with America &apos;s macroeconomic and unemployment crisis .
The US government can currently borrow for 30 years at a real ( inflation-adjusted ) interest rate of 1 % per year .
Suppose that the US government were to borrow an extra $ 500 billion over the next two years and spend it on infrastructure - even unproductively , on projects for which the social rate of return is a measly 25 % per year .
Suppose that - as seems to be the case - the simple Keynesian government-expenditure multiplier on this spending is only two .
In that case , the $ 500 billion of extra federal infrastructure spending over the next two years would produce $ 1 trillion of extra output of goods and services , generate approximately seven million person-years of extra employment , and push down the unemployment rate by two percentage points in each of those years .
And , with tighter labor-force attachment on the part of those who have jobs , the unemployment rate thereafter would likely be about 0.1 percentage points lower in the indefinite future .
The impressive gains don &apos;t stop there .
Better infrastructure would mean an extra $ 20 billion a year of income and social welfare .
A lower unemployment rate into the future would mean another $ 20 billion a year in higher production .
And half of the extra $ 1 trillion of goods and services would show up as consumption goods and services for American households .
In sum , on the benefits side of the equation : More jobs now , $ 500 billion of additional consumption of goods and services over the next two years , and then a $ 40 billion a year flow of higher incomes and production each year thereafter .
So , what are the likely costs of an extra $ 500 billion in infrastructure spending over the next two years ?
For starters , the $ 500 billion of extra government spending would likely be offset by $ 300 billion of increased tax collections from higher economic activity .
So the net result would be a $ 200 billion increase in the national debt .
American taxpayers would then have to pay $ 2 billion a year in real interest on that extra national debt over the next 30 years , and then pay off or roll over the entire $ 200 billion .
The $ 40 billion a year of higher economic activity would , however , generate roughly $ 10 billion a year in additional tax revenue .
Using some of it to pay the real interest on the debt and saving the rest would mean that when the bill comes due , the tax-financed reserves generated by the healthier economy would be more than enough to pay off the additional national debt .
In other words , taxpayers win , because the benefits from the healthier economy would more than compensate for the costs of servicing the higher national debt , enabling the government to provide more services without raising tax rates .
Households win , too , because they get to buy more and nicer things with their incomes .
Companies win , because goods and workers get to use the improved infrastructure .
The unemployed win , because some of them get jobs .
And even bond investors win , because they get their money back , with the interest for which they contracted .
So what is not to like ?
Nothing .
How , you might ask , can I say this ?
I am an economist - a professor of the dismal Science , in which there are no free lunches , in which benefits are always balanced by costs , and in which stories that sound too good to be true almost inevitably are .
But there are two things different about today .
First , the US labor market is failing so badly that expanded government spending carries no resource cost to society as a whole .
Second , bond investors are being really stupid .
In a world in which the S &amp; amp ; P 500 has a 7 % annual earnings yield , nobody should be happy holding a US government 30-year inflation-adjusted bond that yields 1 % per year .
That six-percentage-point difference in anticipated real yield is a measure of bond investors &quot; extraordinary and irrational panic .
They are willing to pay 6 % per year for &quot; safety . &quot;
Right now , however , the US government can manufacture &quot; safety &quot; out of thin air merely by printing bonds .
The government , too , would then win by pocketing that 6 % per year of value - though 30 years from now , bondholders who feel like winners now would most likely look at their portfolios &quot; extraordinarily poor performance of over 2011-2041 and rue their strategy .
A French Cure for the Resource Curse
New YORK - The campaign to ensure that companies engaged in extractive activities disclose all of their payments in their host countries is gaining momentum - and France is leading the effort .
President Nicolas Sarkozy should be applauded for supporting a new initiative promoting strict transparency standards for petroleum , gas , and mining companies listed on European stock exchanges .
France , at the heart of the European Union and President of both the G-8 and G-20 this year , is in an exceptional position to encourage such a regulatory move .
With French leadership , 2011 offers a golden opportunity for the most important capital markets to adopt clear , precise rules requiring full financial disclosure by extractive-industry companies to governmental authorities .
Oil , gas , and mining generate billions of dollars per year for governments and companies .
Moreover , these industries often play a central role in the economic development of resource-rich countries .
Yet , despite great natural wealth , a majority of people in these countries lives in poverty .
The actual taxes and payments made by mining , oil , and other extractive-industry companies to governments are usually a well-kept secret , even though most of these governments claim to use the revenue for the public good .
In reality , in far too many countries , ordinary citizens do not benefit from any of this money ; in fact , they must bear the brunt of the environmental and social costs imposed by mining and drilling operations .
Indeed , these well-kept industry and government secrets can have serious and widespread repercussions .
Witness the upheaval in North Africa and the Middle East .
In these countries , many of which are rich in oil and gas , citizens are staging protests against corruption and political repression .
At bottom , they are protesting against the mismanagement of their countries &quot; wealth and resources - with implications that affect the security and affordability of the entire world &apos;s energy supplies .
Transparency is an essential part of the solution .
Citizens everywhere must be assured that oil and gas firms , as well as mining companies , publish all of their relevant financial information , broken down by country and by project , and including all payments made to host-country public budgets .
If European regulators can agree on this requirement for all extractive-industry companies listed on their stock exchanges , this transparency norm will be applied to companies regardless of where their headquarters are located .
Regulators must also stipulate that company reports be made available on a regular , timely basis , and that they are easily accessible and comparable across countries and other extractive companies .
The United States has already passed legislation requiring public disclosure of payments to governments , through the 2010 Dodd-Frank law .
That law &apos;s requirement that companies fully disclose their revenue streams by country and by project applies to 90 % of international oil and gas companies and to eight of the ten largest mining companies .
This will help citizens track how that money is used , but it will not help them to assess whether their governments are collecting a fair share .
If the EU were to require companies to publish detailed information regarding production and operational numbers , financial and accounting balances , and payments to authorities , companies would become truly accountable to citizens , and government revenues would be augmented .
Such regulatory reform is now under consideration by the European Commission , and French support is imperative if the EU is to announce this month the necessary legislative moves to promote transparency .
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde recently highlighted the necessity of promoting &quot; initiatives within industrial sectors that aim to enhance governance , integrity , and transparency in economic transactions . &quot;
At its just-completed summit in Deauville , France , the G-8 called for the first time for mandatory reporting by oil , gas , and mining companies .
This is an important advance , but , unfortunately , it is qualified by language that allows voluntary approaches as an alternative , and it focuses only on payments transparency .
Now the world must look to the G-20 summit in Cannes this November to make an unequivocal commitment to the reporting requirements needed , given that important emerging economies such as Brazil , India , and China , as well as South Africa and other resource-rich African countries , will be at the table .
The importance of financial transparency in the extractive industries is not limited to one country or era - and it is too important to be left to voluntary efforts alone .
Greater accountability and stronger governance for such companies could potentially change lives , economies , and political systems around the world .
A French Presidential Primer
The late British Prime Minister Harold Wilson used to quip that &quot; a week is a long time in politics . &quot;
So , in the 30 or so weeks between now and the next French presidential election , any prediction made today could be reversed , and reversed again , before the vote .
But two candidates have emerged as clear and constant favorites in opinion polls : Nicolas Sarkozy on the right and Ségolène Royal on the left .
In fact , they have more in common than meets the eye , for each speaks of a rupture with the past while incarnating a form of continuity .
For Sarkozy , &quot; rupture &quot; reflects both mundanely tactical and deeply personal choices .
The 12 years of Jacques Chirac &apos;s presidency , together with France &apos;s tradition of alternation in power , suggests a victory for the left .
Positioning himself as the candidate who represents a sharp break with today &apos;s unpopular politics is the only means to escape that fate .
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; This is reflected in Sarkozy &apos;s openly pro-American stance - an act of political courage in a France where anti-Americanism is running high .
Sarkozy &apos;s message is that Chirac and Villepin were right in substance to oppose America &apos;s military adventure in Iraq , but that their style was disastrously wrong .
Thus , his deep admiration for &quot; American values , &quot; while sincere , implies no embrace of President George W. Bush .
It also reassures the French business community , which was shocked by Dominique de Villepin &apos;s flamboyant opposition to the United States when he was Chirac &apos;s foreign minister .
At home , Sarkozy has aimed his message particularly at the young , issuing a patriotic call to the values of work and discipline , a counter-revolutionary revolution .
The revolution that must be overcome is that of May 1968 , whose leaders and supporters , according to Sarkozy , may have lost politically to de Gaulle , but deeply weakened France over the succeeding decades with their emphasis on &quot; false values . &quot;
By contrast , rebelling against one &apos;s parents &quot; generation and rediscovering traditional moral stances will save France - a message that is highly applicable to issues , such as education and immigration , that may dominate the electoral campaign .
In the case of Royal , the meaning of &quot; rupture &quot; is both more obvious and more visible .
She is seeking to become the first woman President of the French Republic .
To achieve her goal , she prefers to emphasize her &quot; essence , &quot; thereby countering Sarkozy &apos;s stress on his record as a &quot; Doer . &quot;
Her appeal to voters is simple : &quot; I am a woman , and you have never tried a woman , so be modern and try one now . &quot;
Hiding behind the originality ( in French presidential politics ) of her gender , Royal has avoided specifying a detailed program .
When challenged by inquisitive journalists demanding greater precision about her policy agenda , her highly effective line of defense ( so far ! ) has been : &quot; You would not dare to ask me such a question if I were not a woman ! &quot;
Thus , Royal &apos;s program is her popularity .
In foreign policy , one can only guess what her priorities would be .
As far as Europe is concerned , she seems as &quot; agnostic &quot; as Sarkozy , who , like her , incarnates a new generation of &quot; post-European &quot; leaders .
In terms of values , Royal , too , seems to represent a rupture with May 1968 , with her emphasis on discipline and family .
According to public opinion polls , Royal is the clear favorite of the left and the only candidate able to defeat Sarkozy .
Her support is particularly strong among women voters .
For the Socialist Party , which is eager to return to power but has not yet recovered from the humiliating defeat of Lionel Jospin in the first round of the presidential election in 2002 , the question is whether it can afford to resist the wave of favorable public opinion behind Royal .
In the opinion of Royal &apos;s many opponents among Socialist leaders and militants , the dominance of the media in the political process is leading to mediocrity : The qualities required to be elected are becoming nearly incompatible with those needed to govern .
According to Royal &apos;s Socialist critics , the &quot; Hollywoodization &quot; of politics from which she benefits entails a new approach in which leaders follow and followers lead .
But the same criticism can be directed at Sarkozy .
Moreover , both candidates embody continuity - with Chirac &apos;s Gaullist side for Sarkozy and with François Mitterrand for Royal - as much as rupture .
Royal openly claims Mitterand &apos;s legacy as she searches for legitimacy , while Sarkozy &apos;s rejection of Chirac &apos;s legacy has more to do with form than substance .
To a large extent , Sarkozy can be seen as Chirac with more , whereas Royal is clearly Mitterrand with less .
When the voters decide in the spring of 2007 , their choice may depend more on negative than positive considerations , as it did in 2002 , when Chirac faced the odious nationalist Jean-Marie Le Pen in the second round .
As in 2002 , the winner next year will be whomever the electorate dislikes or fears less .
But one way or the other , personalities will prevail over programs .
A Fresh Start for China and Japan ?
Edmonton - Chinese President Hu Jintao will make a high-profile visit to Japan from May 6-10 , making him the second Chinese head of state ever to travel there .
The trip is being carefully managed by both countries , and is being watched closely around the world , with good reason : Sino-Japanese relations over the past decade have been turbulent , to say the least .
When Hu &apos;s predecessor , Jiang Zemin , traveled to Japan ten years ago , bilateral relations were deteriorating : China was unhappy with the Japanese government &apos;s refusal to extend the same apology offered to South Korea for past aggression ; Japan was worried about a rising China and thus turning more confrontational .
The Japanese media &apos;s coverage of the visit was overwhelmingly negative , and it was remembered as a public-relations disaster .
Hu succeeded Jiang in 2002 , almost as former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi was coming to power in Japan , and encouraged &quot; New Thinking &quot; in China &apos;s Japan policy , which would entail moving away from historical grievances and promoting better ties .
But , instead of accepting China &apos;s olive branch , Koizumi implemented a more nationalistic agenda , including annual visits to the Yasukuni Shine , which is regarded as a symbol of Japanese militarism by Japan &apos;s neighbors .
His hard-line approach isolated Japan and angered China , leading to an outburst of anti-Japanese demonstrations in China in 2005 .
But both Japan and China recognize that further tension will serve neither country &apos;s long-term interests .
Koizumi &apos;s successors , Prime Ministers Shinzo Abe and Yasuo Fukuda , have sought to engage China over the past two years , with summits in Beijing and a successful visit by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao to Japan last year .
Hu &apos;s trip is likely follow the example set by Wen .
He will emphasize common strategic interests , highlight mutual economic benefits , generate positive public opinion , and promote further exchanges .
Japan is not only one of China &apos;s largest trade and investment partners , it is also the most powerful neighbor with which China wants to be on good terms , partly to showcase that China &apos;s rise is not a threat to Asia and the rest of the world .
Japan , whose economic recovery is attributable largely to its deepening ties with China in recent years , is also eager to demonstrate that it regards China not as a threat but as an opportunity , as least in economic terms .
It was 30 years ago that former Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda , the father of today &apos;s prime minister , signed a Peace and Friendship Treaty with China .
The two governments will certainly use Hu &apos;s visit to celebrate the anniversary with new programs designed to enhance bilateral understanding and friendship .
But , unlike three decades ago , when the Japanese regarded China as one of their most favored countries , public opinion in both countries nowadays registers more negative feelings than positive ones .
Behind the smiles , the polite interactions , and the cautiously worded diplomatic language , strong undercurrents of suspicion remain .
One problem is the disputed waters of the East China Sea .
Despite new joint projects in energy efficiency and environmental protection , areas in which China ranks Japan as the best performer among industrialized countries , the two sides remain in bitterly divided over these territorial waters , which contain huge potential oil , gas , and other mineral deposits .
Even after many rounds of talks , no resolution is in sight , and Hu &apos;s visit is not expected to produce any breakthroughs .
Then there are strategic suspicions .
Fukuda has dropped Abe &apos;s talk about an &quot; arch of freedom &quot; - an effort to forge a bloc with the United States , Australia , and India .
But Japan remains concerned about China &apos;s rapidly modernizing military , while China worries about a potential US-Japan containment strategy for China , especially in the case of a crisis in the Taiwan Straits .
So , although both sides endorse the idea of a &quot; mutually beneficial strategic relationship , &quot; and despite progress bilateral on military exchanges , mutual trust and confidence-building have a long way to go .
Moreover , today &apos;s &quot; warm politics , cool economics &quot; trend is the reverse of the &quot; cold politics , warm economics &quot; pattern under Koizumi .
Last year , Japan &apos;s committed investment projects in China fell 24 % from 2006 , while actual investment volume decreased by 25 % , partly owing to regulatory changes in China regarding foreign investment .
Recent food safety issues , such as the &quot; poisoned dumplings &quot; cases , have clearly heightened the Japanese public &apos;s sensitivity about Chinese exports .
Finally , historical issues could still resurface to cause new problems .
While Fukuda has made it clear that he will not visit the Yasukuni Shrine , 160 other parliamentarians paid homage at the site last month , an indication that conservative forces in Japan remain strong and that future prime ministers may not abstain from visiting Yasukuni .
And Japan has so far failed to live up to its treaty obligations to clean up between 700,000 and two million chemical weapons that were abandoned in China by the Japanese army at the end of World War II , another potential flash point if any of these weapons causes casualties in China .
A Fresh Start for Europe
As Europe &apos;s leaders gather in Portugal to put the finishing touches on the new , slimmed down , Reform Treaty , it might be helpful if they all pretended that the last 50 years of European integration had never taken place .
Let &apos;s then imagine what Europe needs to do to confront its most pressing challenges , especially if it were able to do so without the political constraints of 50 years of EU deal-making and ramshackle institution-building .
On top of that , let us make a major leap of imagination and suppose that even though this scenario of the EU at &quot; Year Zero &quot; means we would not have a half-century of intra-European cooperation to draw on , the nations that today make up the EU would nevertheless be keen to adopt far-reaching joint policies .
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; Let &apos;s suspend our disbelief , then , and try to imagine what Europe could and should be doing to tackle some of the most far-reaching and obstinate policy challenges that will determine whether the next 50 years are as constructive as the last .
Or , to put it another way , let &apos;s look at our problems in the light of the EU &apos;s existing mechanisms and its potential for creating far-reaching new policies , and then let &apos;s ask ourselves why the EU isn &apos;t realizing its own potential and delivering the goods .
Broadly , we see three areas in which Europe &apos;s policymakers at both the national and EU levels can do better : Global challenges where Europe could show greater leadership , the creation and strengthening of human capital within the EU and worldwide , and improvement in the effectiveness of the EU &apos;s own political machinery .
Europe needs a clearer and more recognizable global agenda .
It needs to build substantially on its leadership on climate change by adopting much tougher EU goals , and then use its international economic and trade clout to champion new global emissions standards that scientific opinion can accept as meaningful .
On conflict and security issues , Europe should be advancing to a new phase in which it takes much clearer and unambiguous positions on issues ranging from nuclear proliferation to sanctions against Burma &apos;s military regime .
The purpose must be to establish Europe as a forceful and fair-minded player on the world stage , rather than as a &quot; broad church &quot; in which different viewpoints co-exist .
The aim should be that &quot; soft power &quot; instruments like EU development aid and economic partnerships would be linked with a growing sense of political and security outreach to ensure Europe is a global player to be reckoned with .
That means , of course , that the EU should seek to widen its transatlantic thinking so that the EU and the United States cooperate more closely on defining - and thus protecting - their common interests in a world where together they account for little more than 10 % of the total population .
These points are far from a blanket criticism of the EU &apos;s efforts to create a common foreign and security policy .
But they are intended to underline what many people in Europe know very well , which is that the speed with which problems concerning international development and conflict are growing easily outpaces the EU &apos;s policy responses so far .
Building more human capital in Europe and worldwide is a crucially important element in future EU activities .
Education is by far the most profitable investment Europe can make , so it should be launching its most ambitious strategy ever to create a new knowledge dynamic and employment inside the EU while helping to expand greatly education in the world &apos;s poorest countries .
Europe also must at last grasp the nettle of immigration policy - something that has persistently eluded generations of political leaders .
Agreed EU-wide immigration rules are needed to reconcile shrinking Europe &apos;s hunger for imported labor with widespread fears of cultural tensions and social unrest .
It won &apos;t be easy to create a fairer and more multi-cultural Europe , but failure to address this problem openly will carry an even heavier price .
By much the same token , Europe &apos;s governments should be making a determined new effort to strengthen Europeans &quot; sense of a shared history and common values .
A stronger European identity is the soundest basis for creating the more multi-cultural society that demographers regard as inevitable .
Meanwhile , doubts still surround the political and institutional machinery the EU will need to realize these and other ambitious goals .
Sighs of relief greeted EU leaders &quot; mid-year agreement on a Reform Treaty aimed at overhauling the Union &apos;s decision-making mechanisms , but it is still uncertain whether the new pact will survive the ratification process in 27 countries .
We believe , though , that the increased use of qualified majority voting by member governments embodied in the new treaty should also be applied to the ratification process itself .
That way , if a small minority of EU governments prove unable to ratify the treaty , it would not be torpedoed the way that its predecessor , the Constitutional Treaty , was in 2005 .
A Gazan Education
Gaza - This was supposed to be my first year of medical school .
Instead , I am stuck here in Gaza , in my father &apos;s house inside the Jabalia refugee camp , with few options and no way out .
After I finished high school last year , I decided to become a doctor .
Gaza cries out for bone specialists , but the training I need is available only abroad .
When I won a place at a medical college in Germany , my parents were proud .
I was excited to follow my older brother , who is already studying there .
In February , the German authorities granted me an entrance visa .
I wasted no time in asking the Israeli authorities for permission to travel to Europe . But I was told that only patients in need of emergency medical evacuation would be allowed out - not students .
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; Hundreds of other young people trapped in the Gaza Strip have won admission to study abroad .
For many of us , this is our only opportunity to continue our education .
Gaza is one of the most densely populated places on earth , and one of the poorest - 1.5 million of us live on a patch of land about 41 kilometers long and 6-12 kilometers wide .
The local hospitals lack the equipment needed to perform many important procedures , like radiation treatments for cancer patients and heart surgery .
Universities in Gaza are overcrowded and starved for supplies .
Many subjects are not even taught , and there are few post-graduate programs .
Instructors from abroad cannot enter Gaza .
Without the ability to go overseas , we cannot learn .
In June , after the United States pressured Israel to allow Fulbright scholarship winners to leave the Gaza Strip , the Israeli military announced that it would grant exit permits for a few more students with &quot; recognized &quot; scholarships - but not &quot; hundreds . &quot;
So hundreds of us are still waiting , most without prestigious scholarships to draw the world &apos;s attention .
I am sure to be one of the many who will not be allowed to leave .
Life in Gaza has bled away my optimism .
My father is a teacher and owns a children &apos;s clothing shop .
My mother is a Housekeeper .
I have six brothers and three sisters .
We returned to Palestine in 1996 from Saudi Arabia , where my father had been working as a teacher .
That was at the height of the peace process .
My parents put their hope in the Oslo Accords signed in 1993 , and decided that they could give us a better life here .
But when I was ten , the secondintifada began .
The peace process was collapsing throughout my teenage years .
During my third year of high school , the Israeli authorities closed off the Gaza Strip .
Israeli border controls have reduced the flow of people crossing the border to a trickle , and have suffocated Gaza &apos;s economy , choking off imports and exports and cutting fuel deliveries and electricity .
There is no clothing left in my father &apos;s shop , which was supposed to support my brother and me during our studies .
With the backing of the US , Canada , and the European Union , Israel has maintained its blockade in an attempt to defeat Hamas , which won the elections here in 2006 .
But the blockade only makes people more desperate .
Hamas and other armed groups , I know , have launched rocket attacks from the Gaza Strip that have killed civilians in Israeli towns and villages .
But I also have witnessed how Israel has retaliated with air strikes and armed incursions into the Gaza Strip , including Jabalia .
Israel &apos;s blockade amounts to collective punishment . It is hurting all of us , whether we support Hamas or not .
It is also destroying my dream to write &quot; Specialist in Bone Medicine &quot; after my name .
Sometimes , I am sorry that I am from Gaza .
But my hope is still to go abroad , learn skills , and return to help others here .
Sometimes , when there is electricity , I watch television and see how people live in other places .
I ask myself why they have the opportunity to travel , to study , to take vacations , when I cannot go abroad even to learn medicine .
We are students , not soldiers .
We are not fighters in this conflict .
Why doesn &apos;t Israel let us go study ?
Why do Europe and America support a blockade of young minds ?
Soon , my fellow classmates at the medical college will be starting classes .
When they do , I will probably still be here in my father &apos;s house , waiting for the blockade to end .
A German Conservative Credo
Few concepts are as elastic as that of &quot; conservatism . &quot;
At one end of its spectrum of meanings , conservatism has ( over the last two decades ) come to be viewed as promoting too much of a civic life of greed and grab .
At the other end , conservatism in many European countries has historically veered too close for comfort to right-wing extremism . In Germany today , conservatism was forged in the wake of the Weimar Republic &apos;s failures , experiences unknown to Anglo-Saxon conservatives .
This history accounts for the type of conservatism practiced by the Christian-Democratic Union ( CDU ) and Christian-Social Union ( CSU ) , who focus on moderation and balance , preservation and innovation , and on commanding Germany &apos;s political center .
With federal elections due in Germany this autumn , much will be said about the nature of German conservatism .
Some , looking at CDU / CSU candidate for Chancellor Edmund Stoiber &apos;s emphasis on Bavaria &apos;s economic success , will seek to portray the coalition as shaded dangerously by the &quot; anything goes &quot; market conservatism practiced in America .
Others , pointing to the German conservatives &apos; emphasis on social values , will say that we are as statist as the Social Democrats .
The truth itself is far more complex than these facile comparisons , which also makes it more durable .
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; CDU / CSU policies are , of course , founded on the idea of individual freedom , but we believe in an individualism tempered by Western culture and the Christian tradition .
We are skeptical about unfettered individualism because of our awareness of man &apos;s sins , but also because of our profound awareness of the historical defects and aberrations in Germany &apos;s 20th century history .
Yet , despite this deeply ingrained skepticism about human nature , we embrace humanity &apos;s talent for progress and innovation , because we recognize man &apos;s ability to correct mistakes and errors .
These two traits , although they seem to conflict , and are certainly different from the values of American and British conservatives , nonetheless form a sound basis for a realistic pragmatism and the shunning of ideological politics - which is precisely the politics that Germany now requires .
Far from being willing to coerce people to live in a certain way , German conservatives seek a politics that recognizes limits - the limits of the state , the market , and the individual .
We conceive of politics as a mechanism to reconcile enduring conflicts , such as those that exist between freedom and security .
Each , indeed , is unsustainable without the other .
Security is useless without freedom , but freedom makes no sense without security - both national security and economic security .
The social market economy , which we continue to embrace , is based on these principles .
It sees competition as the most effective means to promote economic growth , but also embraces state interference , when necessary , to secure equality of opportunity , social solidarity , and social balance .
This interference is also intended to help avoid the &quot; economization &quot; of all aspects of civic life .
The market is merely a tool , not an answer to every human problem .
It is in recognition of this fact that German conservatives strive , for example , to strike a balance between economy and ecology .
We feel responsible , on a global level , for the environment , which is why we disagree with unilateral decisions by individual nations when such decisions ignore the needs of the rest of the world .
For globalization is both a challenge and an opportunity .
As we open ourselves to the wind &apos;s of globalization , we must also strengthen the local institutions that foster social ties and identity , such as the family , local and regional communities , religious communities , and the tradition of voluntary worker solidarity - all which have been neglected in recent years .
This is the principle of &quot; subsidiarity &quot; which supports placing decision-making power , wherever and whenever possible , in governmental bodies nearest to the individual citizen .
This is of particular importance for our ideas about the European Union , where we seek an effective balance between the nation and Europe .
For German conservatives , European integration and national identity are not warring concepts , as they seem to be to our opponents and so many others .
They are , instead , two sides of the same coin .
The EU was founded in recognition that certain goals could only be achieved through cooperation .
Decades later , the European Union still needs the binding power and legitimacy of its constituent nations , as well as of historical regional political structures within those nations , because a common European identity is emerging only slowly and cannot yet justify a unitary constitutional structure .
In essence , the form of government we seek within Germany and across Europe is built on a sense of moral discourse and moral decision-making rather than on the supposedly eternal truth of some abstract political concept .
Indeed , only an ongoing skepticism of fashionable political nostrums - both of the statist and market fundamentalist variety - can promote pluralism and tolerance , and avoid a ballooning of the bureaucracy that enfeebles our economy .
In a fast changing world , this skepticism of the center is the only sensible attitude a responsible political party and government can strike .
Our political approach embraces this humane and realistic pragmatism , for it is only such an approach that offers a chance to secure a prosperous stability within which necessary change can be made without ending up in an extremist euphoria or a fear of the future .
Moderation , tolerance , and a capacity for reform in equal measure are the watchwords of today &apos;s German conservatism .
A German Europe ?
Lisbon / Riga - Is the Europe that is emerging from the euro crisis a German one ?
During the euro crisis , power in the European Union seems to have shifted towards national capitals in general , and towards one national capital in particular : Berlin .
But , with Germany introverted , France downgraded , and Britain semi-detached , the big story in European foreign policy is that the time has come for the little guy who thinks big .
In this Europe , the important moves are now sometimes made in Stockholm or Warsaw , not only in Berlin , Paris , or London .
And , with major foreign-policy issues on Europe &apos;s doorstep - whether in Egypt , Belarus , or now Syria - useful European initiatives are to be welcomed , regardless of where they originate .
Germany , in foreign policy as well as in economics , can exert decisive leadership in the EU - when it wants to .
For example , together with Poland , it led the EU &apos;s attempt to develop a coordinated approach to Russia , and it flexed its muscles on Serbia .
But , on other issues - for example , Libya - Germany did not so much lead as use its newfound room for maneuver to follow its own preferences in the face of other EU members .
So the answer today to Henry Kissinger &apos;s famous question about whom he should call when he wants to speak to Europe , is not necessarily &quot; the German chancellor . &quot;
While Berlin is increasingly imposing its economic preferences on others in the eurozone , it is not prepared to use military force as a foreign-policy tool , as it demonstrated in the case of Libya .
Moreover , Germany , it seems , is becoming a &quot; geo-economic power &quot; driven by the needs of its export sector .
By using economic means to pursue its foreign-policy ends , Germany is gradually turning its back on its European partners .
Meanwhile , as France experiences a loss of power relative to Germany on economic issues , it continues to play a decisive role in foreign policy .
France led the Libya operation , and is doing much the same with attempts to impose stronger sanctions against Iran and provide support for the United Nations in Côte d &apos;Ivoire .
But France &apos;s unilateral approach often antagonizes its European partners .
For example , French President Nicolas Sarkozy preempted a common European position on the Palestinian statehood bid at the UN in September .
In other words , even when France leads , it does not always do so in a constructive way .
Apart from the decisive role that it played in Libya alongside France , Britain is becoming increasingly marginal in European foreign policymaking .
Even before it vetoed a plan by eurozone countries to create a &quot; fiscal union &quot; at the European summit in December 2011 , it was playing less of a leadership role than it traditionally has on key European foreign-policy issues .
Britain has continued to support EU enlargement , closer links with Turkey , and development in Africa , but it has not launched any creative initiatives to bring other member states along or change the terms of the EU debate .
On other issues , such as engaging &quot; strategic partners &quot; - China and Russia in particular - the United Kingdom is often a follower as well .
As the &quot; big three &quot; increasingly pursue their own narrowly defined national interests , however , other EU member states are emerging as leaders in key foreign-policy fields .
For example , Sweden - the 14th largest member state in terms of population , and eighth in terms of GDP - under the leadership of Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt and Foreign Minister Carl Bildt punches considerably above its weight .
Last year , it increased annual aid to North Africa by SEK100 million ( € 11.1 million ) , proposed an EU mission to Tunisia just a week after the revolution to support democratic aspirations there , and was an early and strong backer of UN resolutions in support of the uprising in Libya .
Poland , too , is emerging as a foreign-policy leader .
Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski have particularly taken the initiative on the EU &apos;s strategy towards Russia , where Poland has largely overcome its differences with Germany and is now at the forefront of efforts to develop a genuinely comprehensive approach .
Poland has also led on European defense ( though it declined to take part in the military intervention in Libya ) .
This reflects the strength of the Polish economy , which is expected to grow by more than 3 % in 2012 - faster than almost anywhere else in the EU .
Germany might be getting all of the attention in this time of crisis , but the last year has been a reminder that Europe is most effective and influential when the small countries get involved and join forces with - and even lead - the big ones .
For example , on Iran ( with exceptions like Greece ) , Europeans have united around a clear policy and collective positions , such as an oil embargo .
So , Poland and Sweden : &amp; nbsp ; Europe needs your leadership .
But that might not be enough in an EU with more than 500 million citizens .
Other EU states need to follow their example in order to make European foreign policy truly effective and influential .
A Global Agenda for Seven Billion
New YORK - Late next month , a child will be born - the 7th billion citizen of planet Earth . We will never know the circumstances into which he or she was born .
We do know that the baby will enter a world of vast and unpredictable change - environmental , economic , geopolitical , technological , and demographic .
The world &apos;s population has tripled since the United Nations was created in 1945 .
And our numbers keep growing , with corresponding pressures on land , energy , food , and water . The global economy is generating pressures as well : Rising joblessness , widening social inequalities , and the emergence of new economic powers .
These trends link the fate and future of today &apos;s seven billion people as never before . No nation alone can solve the great global challenges of the twenty-first century . International cooperation is a universal need .

The 66th session of the UN General Assembly is a renewed opportunity for the countries of the world to set aside narrow , short-term interests and commit to cooperative efforts to address humanity &apos;s long-term imperatives .
At a time when all nations are experiencing individual challenges , we need to forge a worldwide common agenda that can help to ensure that the seven billionth baby and future generations grow up in a world characterized by sustainable peace , prosperity , freedom , and justice .
To help create this future , I am focusing my second term as Secretary-General on five global imperatives - five generational opportunities to shape the world of tomorrow by the decisions we make today .

The first and greatest of these imperatives is sustainable development . We all must understand that saving our planet , lifting people out of poverty , and advancing economic growth are one and the same fight . We must connect the dots between climate change , water scarcity , energy shortages , global health , food security , and women &apos;s empowerment . Solutions to one problem must be solutions for all .

In the next five years , we need to create a new economic vision for sustainable development and forge global consensus on a binding climate change agreement .
Fostering economic growth , realizing the Millennium Development Goals , and combating climate change will all depend on creating a new energy system for the twenty-first century and extending it to every person on the planet .
Prevention as a framework for international cooperation is a second opportunity .
This year , the UN peacekeeping budget will total $ 8 billion . Think of what we could save by avoiding conflicts - by deploying political mediation missions , for example , rather than troops .
We know how to do this .
Our record proves it - in Guinea , Kenya , and Kyrgyzstan .
A third imperative is building a safer and more secure world . In this effort , we must be courageous in standing up for democracy , human rights , and peace .
This year was one of signature achievements in restoring and securing peace - in Côte d &apos;Ivoire , Darfur , Egypt , and elsewhere . But hatred and bloodshed still stand in the way of our vision for peace .
In the Middle East , we must break the stalemate .
Palestinians deserve a state .
Israel needs security .
Both want peace . A negotiated settlement can produce these outcomes , and the UN is a platform for forging such a peace .
So , too , will we continue our efforts to foster democratic governance in Iraq , Afghanistan , the Democratic Republic of Congo , and Sierra Leone . And , in the name of all of humanity , we will continue to push forward on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation , in service of realizing a world free of nuclear weapons .
The fourth big opportunity is supporting countries in transition .
This year &apos;s dramatic events in North Africa and the Middle East inspired people around the globe .
Let us help make the Arab Spring a true season of hope for all .
In Libya , we are deploying a new UN support mission to assist the country &apos;s transitional authorities in establishing a new government and legal order , consistent with the aspirations of the Libyan people .
Syria is a special concern .
For six months we have seen escalating violence and repression .
The government has repeatedly pledged to undertake reforms and listen to its people .
It has not done so .
The moment to act is now .
The violence must stop .
Last but not least is the imperative of working with and for women and young people .
Women hold up more than half the sky and represent much of the world &apos;s unrealized potential .
We need their full engagement - in government , business , and civil society .
The UN has placed a high priority on promoting women at all levels of the Organization and this year , for the first time , UN Women is operating to promote the interests and rights of women all over the world .
Seven billion people now look toward the United Nations for solutions to the world &apos;s great global challenges .
They hold different religions and backgrounds but common dreams and aspirations .
Our global future depends on bringing these individual talents and universal rights together in common cause .
Let our common agenda begin .
A Global Civics Lesson
Istanbul - The reality of the world &apos;s epic interdependence is well known .
We have seen how financial engineering in the United States can determine economic growth in every part of the world ; how carbon-dioxide emissions from China end up influencing crop yields and livelihoods in Vietnam , Bangladesh , the Maldives , and beyond ; how an epidemic in Mexico endangers the rhythm of public life in the US ; or how volcanic ash from Iceland affects travel across Europe .
We are also familiar with the inherent difficulties of devising and implementing solutions to global problems through nation-states , and have relied on two broad models to deal with this predicament .
The first is composed of a wide range of creative ad hoc alliances and solutions .
When standard global public health instruments proved insufficient , for example , we built the Global Fund to Fight Tuberculosis , AIDS , and Malaria .
When the Internet became global , its management was turned over to ICANN , the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers , which enlists the voices of individual Internet users in its governance - a significant departure from intergovernmental multilateralism .
The US , as the most powerful member of the international system , tends to prefer ad hoc approaches to global governance .
With its vast resources and alliances , ad hoc solutions allow the US to advance its interests effectively without the entanglements of more enduring rules , customs , and structures .
Europeans prefer a more systematic reliance on the rule of law , and also on what has come to be known as the global public-goods paradigm .
Adherents of this view point first and foremost to the existence of certain vital global public goods , climate being the most obvious example .
By definition , public goods mean a collective-action problem .
The global public-goods paradigm also implies some commensurability , if not uniformity , in the way we respond to various global collective-action challenges .
Americans tend to find this expectation of commensurability suffocating , while Europeans find it reassuring and liberating .
( The developing world has been largely absent in this debate , with notable exceptions in the form of indignation about unfairness built into the status quo , peppered with obstructionism . )
Like many other cardinal questions , the tension between these approaches is unlikely to be resolved conclusively .
We are more likely to live with this tension for a long time , with emphasis shifting back and forth between approaches .
It would thus be much more worthwhile to focus on a neglected issue : What responsibilities do we all have toward people who happen not to be our compatriots ?
Both the ad hoc and the global public-goods schools shy away from this question , and yet without at least some working answer , we will lack the compass needed to navigate our increasing global interdependence .
We need to recognize that global governance is not a technocratic puzzle to be solved by clever institutional design .
We cannot establish an effective social contract without an explicit understanding of our responsibilities towards each other - and of the rights that emerge alongside those responsibilities .
The answers are to be found not only in the speeches given at the United Nations General Assembly or at the Davos World Economic Forum , but in the conversations we have with our friends , families , and colleagues .
We must all consider what responsibilities we are willingly ready to accept , and then discuss our answers with others .
This will mean starting to imagine - without panic or rush , and with all the care and thoughtfulness that this conversation requires - a global civics .
Current and probable future levels of global connectivity and interdependence enable and require us to commence this conversation .
Whether or not we realize it , we have comparable conversations every day .
For example , every day millions of people drive at high speeds encased in a ton of metal , and they do so extremely close to others who are doing the same thing .
A slight move of the steering wheel in the wrong direction would wreak havoc , but we cruise carefree , because we have reasonable expectations about the behavior of other drivers .
Our expectations of other drivers , which serve to mitigate the theoretical risks of driving , can exist because people adhere to a framework of laws , habits , and conventions about how to operate automobiles .
In an increasingly interdependent world , we need a corresponding global framework to put our minds at relative ease .
That framework has to be based on global civics , a system of conscious responsibilities that we are ready to take on - and corresponding rights that we are ready to claim - after due deliberation .
To imagine the shape of global civics , a worthwhile exercise would be to take 15 minutes to consider what we would say to the seven billionth human being - who will join us in less than a thousand days - about the human condition awaiting her .
This hypothetical conversation would help us take stock of global conditions that we have all helped produce , and would set us on a path toward discovering our core responsibilities to each other and the next generation - the essence of global civics .
A Global Green New Deal
Nairobi - With unemployment soaring , bankruptcies climbing , and stock markets in free-fall , it may at first glance seem sensible to ditch the fight against climate change and put environmental investments on hold .
But this would be a devastating mistake of immediate , as well as inter-generational , proportions .
Far from burdening an already over-stressed , over-stretched global economy , environmental investments are exactly what is needed to get people back to work , get order books flowing , and assist in powering economies back to health .
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; In the past , concern for the environment was viewed as a luxury ; today , it is a necessity - a point grasped by some , but by no means all , economic architects yet .
A big slice of President Barack Obama &apos;s $ 825 billion stimulus package for the United States includes a boost to renewable energy , &quot; weatherizing &quot; a million homes , and upgrading the country &apos;s inefficient electricity grid .
Such investments could generate an estimated five million &quot; green-collar &quot; jobs , provide a shot in the arm for the construction and engineering industries , and get America back into the equally serious business of combating climate change and achieving energy security .
The Republic of Korea , which is losing jobs for the first time in more than five years , has also spotted the green lining to grim economic times .
President Lee Myung-bak &apos;s government plans to invest $ 38 billion employing people to clean up four major rivers and reduce disaster risks by building embankments and water-treatment facilities .
Other elements of Lee &apos;s plan include construction of eco-friendly transportation networks , such as high-speed railways and hundreds of kilometers of bicycle tracks , and generating energy using waste methane from landfills . The package also counts on investments in hybrid vehicle technologies .
Similar pro-employment &quot; Green New Deal &quot; packages have been lined up in China , Japan , and the United Kingdom .
They are equally relevant to developing economies in terms of jobs , fighting poverty , and creating new opportunities at a time of increasingly uncertain commodity prices and exports .
In South Africa , the government-backedWorking for Water initiative - which employs more than 30,000 people , including women , youth , and the disabled - also sees opportunity in crisis .
The country spends roughly $ 60 million annually fighting invasive alien plants that threaten native wildlife , water supplies , important tourism destinations , and farmland .
This work is set to expand as more than 40 million tons of invasive alien plants are harvested for power-station fuel .
As a result , an estimated 500 megawatts of electricity , equal to 2 % of the country &apos;s electricity needs , will be generated , along with more than 5,000 jobs .
So it is clear that some countries now view environmental investments in infrastructure , energy systems , and ecosystems as among the best bets for recovery .
Others may be unsure about the potential returns from investing in ecosystem services such as forest carbon storage or in renewable energy for the 80 % of Africans who have no access to electricity .
Still others may simply be unaware of how to precisely follow suit .
In early February , the United Nations Environment Program will convene some of the world &apos;s leading economists at the UN &apos;s headquarters in New York .
A strategy for a Global Green New Deal , tailored to different national challenges , will be fleshed out in order to assist world leaders and ministers craft stimulus packages that work on multiple fronts .
The Global Green New Deal , which UNEP launched as a concept in October 2008 , responds to the current economic malaise .
Spent wisely , however , these stimulus packages could trigger far-reaching and transformational trends , setting the stage for a more sustainable , urgently needed Green Economy for the twenty-first century .
The trillions of dollars that have been mobilized to address current woes , together with the trillions of investors &quot; dollars waiting in the wings , represent an opportunity that was unthinkable only 12 months ago : The chance to steer a more resource-efficient and intelligent course that can address problems ranging from climate change and natural-resource scarcity to water shortages and biodiversity loss .
Blindly pumping the current bail-out billions into old industries and exhausted economic models will be throwing good money after bad while mortgaging our children &apos;s future .
Instead , political leaders must use these windfalls to invest in innovation , promote sustainable businesses , and encourage new patterns of decent , long-lasting employment .
A Global Perfect Storm
New YORK - Dark , lowering financial and economic clouds are , it seems , rolling in from every direction : The eurozone , the United States , China , and elsewhere .
Indeed , the global economy in 2013 could be a very difficult environment in which to find shelter .
For starters , the eurozone crisis is worsening , as the euro remains too strong , front-loaded fiscal austerity deepens recession in many member countries , and a credit crunch in the periphery and high oil prices undermine prospects of recovery .
The eurozone banking system is becoming balkanized , as cross-border and interbank credit lines are cut off , and capital flight could turn into a full run on periphery banks if , as is likely , Greece stages a disorderly euro exit in the next few months .
Moreover , fiscal and sovereign-debt strains are becoming worse as interest-rate spreads for Spain and Italy have returned to their unsustainable peak levels .
Indeed , the eurozone may require not just an international bailout of banks ( as recently in Spain ) , but also a full sovereign bailout at a time when eurozone and international firewalls are insufficient to the task of backstopping both Spain and Italy .
As a result , disorderly breakup of the eurozone remains possible .
Farther to the west , US economic performance is weakening , with first-quarter growth a miserly 1.9 % - well below potential .
And job creation faltered in April and May , so the US may reach stall speed by year end .
Worse , the risk of a double-dip recession next year is rising : Even if what looks like a looming US fiscal cliff turns out to be only a smaller source of drag , the likely increase in some taxes and reduction of some transfer payments will reduce growth in disposable income and consumption .
Moreover , political gridlock over fiscal adjustment is likely to persist , regardless of whether Barack Obama or mitt Romney wins November &apos;s presidential election .
Thus , new fights on the debt ceiling , risks of a government shutdown , and rating downgrades could further depress consumer and business confidence , reducing spending and accelerating a flight to safety that would exacerbate the fall in stock markets .
In the east , China , its growth model unsustainable , could be underwater by 2013 , as its investment bust continues and reforms intended to boost consumption are too little too late .
A new Chinese leadership must accelerate structural reforms to reduce national savings and increase consumption &apos;s share of GDP ; but divisions within the leadership about the pace of reform , together with the likelihood of a bumpy political transition , suggest that reform will occur at a pace that simply is not fast enough .
The economic slowdown in the US , the eurozone , and China already implies a massive drag on growth in other emerging markets , owing to their trade and financial links with the US and the European Union ( that is , no &quot; decoupling &quot; has occurred ) .
At the same time , the lack of structural reforms in emerging markets , together with their move towards greater state capitalism , is hampering growth and will reduce their resiliency .
Finally , long-simmering tensions in the Middle East between Israel and the US on one side and Iran on the other on the issue of nuclear proliferation could reach a boil by 2013 .
The current negotiations are likely to fail , and even tightened sanctions may not stop Iran from trying to build nuclear weapons .
With the US and Israel unwilling to accept containment of a nuclear Iran by deterrence , a military confrontation in 2013 would lead to a massive oil price spike and global recession .
These risks are already exacerbating the economic slowdown : Equity markets are falling everywhere , leading to negative wealth effects on consumption and capital spending .
Borrowing costs are rising for highly indebted sovereigns , credit rationing is undermining small and medium-size companies , and falling commodity prices are reducing exporting countries &quot; income .
Increasing risk aversion is leading economic agents to adopt a wait-and-see stance that makes the slowdown partly self-fulfilling .
Compared to 2008-2009 , when policymakers had ample space to act , monetary and fiscal authorities are running out of policy bullets ( or , more cynically , policy rabbits to pull out of their hats ) .
Monetary policy is constrained by the proximity to zero interest rates and repeated rounds of quantitative easing .
Indeed , economies and markets no longer face liquidity problems , but rather credit and insolvency crises .
Meanwhile , unsustainable budget deficits and public debt in most advanced economies have severely limited the scope for further fiscal stimulus .
Using exchange rates to boost net exports is a zero-sum game at a time when private and public deleveraging is suppressing domestic demand in countries that are running current-account deficits and structural issues are having the same effect in surplus countries . After all , a weaker currency and better trade balance in some countries necessarily implies a stronger currency and a weaker trade balance in others .
Meanwhile , the ability to backstop , ring-fence , and bail out banks and other financial institutions is constrained by politics and near-insolvent sovereigns &quot; inability to absorb additional losses from their banking systems .
As a result , sovereign risk is now becoming banking risk . Indeed , sovereigns are dumping a larger fraction of their public debt onto banks &quot; balance sheet , especially in the eurozone .
To prevent a disorderly outcome in the eurozone , today &apos;s fiscal austerity should be much more gradual , a growth compact should complement the EU &apos;s new fiscal compact , and a fiscal union with debt mutualization ( Eurobonds ) should be implemented . &amp; nbsp ; In addition , a full banking union , starting with eurozone-wide deposit insurance , should be initiated , and moves toward greater political integration must be considered , even as Greece leaves the eurozone .
Unfortunately , Germany resists all of these key policy measures , as it is fixated on the credit risk to which its taxpayers would be exposed with greater economic , fiscal , and banking integration .
As a result , the probability of a eurozone disaster is rising .
And , while the cloud over the eurozone may be the largest to burst , it is not the only one threatening the global economy .
Batten down the hatches .
A Global Solutions Network
New YORK - Great social change occurs in several ways .
A technological breakthrough - the steam engine , computers , the Internet - may play a leading role .
Visionaries , such as Mahatma Gandhi , Martin Luther King Jr . , and Nelson Mandela , may inspire a demand for justice .
Political leaders may lead a broad reform movement , as with Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal .
Our own generation urgently needs to spur another era of great social change .
This time , we must act to save the planet from a human-induced environmental catastrophe .
Each of us senses this challenge almost daily .
Heat waves , droughts , floods , forest fires , retreating glaciers , polluted rivers , and extreme storms buffet the planet at a dramatically rising rate , owing to human activities .
Our $ 70-trillion-per-year global economy is putting unprecedented pressures on the natural environment .
We will need new technologies , behaviors , and ethics , supported by solid evidence , to reconcile further economic development with environmental sustainability .
United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is taking on this unprecedented challenge from his unique position at the crossroads of global politics and society .
At the political level , the UN is the meeting place for 193 member states to negotiate and create international law , as in the important treaty on climate change adopted at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 .
At the level of global society , the UN represents the world &apos;s citizenry , &quot; we the peoples , &quot; as it says in the UN Charter . &amp; nbsp ; At the societal level , the UN is about the rights and responsibilities of all of us , including future generations .
In the past two decades , governments have come up short on solutions to environmental threats .
Politicians have failed to implement properly the treaties adopted at the 1992 Earth Summit .
Ban knows that strong government action remains vital , but he also recognizes that civil society must also play a larger role , especially because too many governments and politicians are beholden to vested interests , and too few politicians think in time horizons that extend past the next election .
To empower global society to act , Ban has launched a bold new global initiative , for which I am grateful to volunteer .
The UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network is a powerful effort to mobilize global knowledge to save the planet .
The idea is to use global networks of knowledge and action to identify and demonstrate new , cutting-edge approaches to sustainable development around the world .
The network will work alongside and support governments , UN agencies , civil-society organizations , and the private sector .
Humanity needs to learn new ways to produce and use low-carbon energy , grow food sustainably , build livable cities , and manage the global commons of oceans , biodiversity , and the atmosphere .
But time is running very short .
Today &apos;s mega-cities , for example , already have to confront dangerous heat waves , rising sea levels , more extreme storms , dire congestion , and air and water pollution .
Agricultural regions already need to become more resilient in the face of increased climate volatility .
And as one region in one part of the world designs a better way to manage its transport , energy needs , water supplies , or food supplies , those successes should quickly become part of the global knowledge base , enabling other regions to benefit rapidly as well .
Universities have a special role to play in the new UN knowledge network .
Exactly 150 years ago , in 1862 , Abraham Lincoln created America &apos;s &quot; land-grant &quot; universities to help local communities to improve farming and the quality of life through science .
Today , we need universities in all parts of the world to help their societies face the challenges of poverty reduction , clean energy , sustainable food supplies , and the rest .
By linking together , and putting their curricula online , the world &apos;s universities can become even more effective in discovering and promoting science-based solutions to complex problems .
The world &apos;s corporate sector also has a significant role to play in sustainable development .
Now the corporate sector has two faces .
It is the repository of cutting-edge sustainable technologies , pioneering research and development , world-class management , and leadership in environmental sustainability .
Yet at the same time , the corporate sector lobbies aggressively to gut environmental regulations , slash corporate-tax rates , and avoid their own responsibility for ecological destruction .
Sometimes the same company operates on both sides of the divide .
We urgently need far-sighted companies to join the Sustainable Development Solutions Network .
These companies are uniquely placed to move new ideas and technologies into early-stage demonstration projects , thereby accelerating global learning cycles .
Equally important , we need a critical mass of respected corporate leaders to press their peers to cease the anti-environmental lobbying and campaign-finance practices that account for the inaction of governments . &amp; nbsp ;
Sustainable development is a generational challenge , not a short-term task .
The reinvention of energy , food , transport , and other systems will take decades , not years .
But the long-term nature of this challenge must not lull us into inaction .
We must start reinventing our productive systems now , precisely because the path of change will be so long and the environmental dangers are already so pressing . &amp; nbsp ;
At the Rio + 20 Summit this past June , the world &apos;s governments agreed to adopt a new set of goals on sustainable development for the period after 2015 , to build upon the Millennium Development Goals &quot; success in reducing poverty , hunger , and disease .
In the post-2015 era , the fight against poverty and the fight to protect the environment will go hand in hand , reinforcing each other .
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has already initiated several global processes to help establish the new post-2015 goals in an open , participatory , and knowledge-based way . &amp; nbsp ;
The Secretary General &apos;s launch of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network is therefore especially timely .
Not only will the world adopt a new set of goals to achieve sustainable development , but it will also have a new global network of expertise to help achieve those vital objectives . &amp; nbsp ;
A Good Rate Hike for Europe
Two wrongs don &apos;t make a right .
Just because European governments have failed to put bread on their constituents &quot; tables doesn &apos;t mean that the European Central Bank should likewise fail in its job of promoting price stability in the euro zone .
That may sound obvious , but abandoning price stability is exactly what some European politicians are advocating .
For example , Italian politicians , who , given Italy &apos;s recent dismal economic performance , would seem the least qualified to offer the ECB advice on monetary policy , are nonetheless advocating interest-rate cuts .
Echoing comments by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , Deputy Economics Minister Mario Baldassarri said in Il Sole 24 Ore last week that all efforts to boost growth are in vain &quot; if someone is pushing on the brake pedal . &quot;
Who &apos;s he kidding ?
If anyone is &quot; pushing down on the Italian growth brake &quot; it is Berlusconi himself .
He has made no efforts at economic reform during his term and now seeks to blame the ECB for Italy &apos;s lame economic performance .
But it is precisely the lack of economic reform at home that has made Italy one of the least competitive states in the euro-zone economy .
More than the usual &quot; blame game &quot; is at work here .
Pressures are mounting on the ECB to raise interest rates - and Berlusconi and Co . &quot; S attacks are as much as an attempt to forestall future rate hikes as to get the ECB to loosen its monetary policy .
Soaring energy prices , for example , have become a leading inflation risk .
But higher energy prices , by themselves , will not cause the ECB to pull the interest-rate trigger .
The key will be so-called &quot; second-round effects &quot; - whether growing crude prices lead to higher wage demands from trade unions .
So far , the &quot; social partners , &quot; as ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet likes to call the unions , have been quiet .
Should this change , the ECB will have to raise rates even if Europe &apos;s economic growth remains slack .
The good news is that economic growth in the euro-zone economy appears to be picking up ( even in Italy ) .
Though second-quarter GDP growth was weak - the euro-zone average was only 0.3 % year on year - third-quarter data are indicating a sustained economic pick-up in the second half of the year .
Only consumption is lagging .
How will the ECB react to better economic news ?
Some on the Governing Council have grown uncomfortable that euro-zone interest rates have stayed so low , at 2 % , for so long ( more than two years ) .
True , there is no inflation problem in the short run , but the ECB &apos;s monetary policy focuses on the medium term .
One particular worry is that euro-zone money supply is well above the ECB &apos;s benchmark level , indicating an excess supply of liquidity .
It is doubtful that the ECB would raise interest rates to curb excess liquidity so long as economic recovery remains in question .
Slow growth has silenced the monetarists on the ECB &apos;s Governing Council .
This will change , however , once the economic pick-up is confirmed .
Interest-rate hikes may be coming sooner rather than later , which is why Berlusconi and French President Jacques Chirac are talking up interest-rate cuts now .
Meanwhile , in Germany , the elections this September may have surprising consequences for ECB monetary policy .
Angela Merkel , the Christian Democrats &quot; candidate , is a reformer , holding out hope for Germany &apos;s future - and that of Europe .
Unfortunately , Merkel &apos;s campaign is off to a rocky start , and the recent entry of Oskar Lafontaine &apos;s extreme left-wing party into the fray may necessitate the formation of a grand coalition between the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats .
This would be bad news for the German economy , which could delay possible ECB interest rate hikes .
Because the expected gridlock in parliament would make reforms less likely , companies might hold off on investment , while consumers would be more likely to keep their wallets closed , because official policy would be even less clear than it is now .
On the other hand , a center-right coalition between the Christian Democrats and the Free Democrats could spark the ECB into action .
This raises an interesting point .
The public should be relieved if the ECB raises rates , because this would most likely signal that the long-awaited economic recovery is well under way , and that inflationary repercussions are being addressed .
A hike , in other words , would indicate that good things are happening .
But the public often views interest-rate increases as negative events that increase unemployment and stifle growth .
Blame-game politicians like Berlusconi , who have failed to put bread on the table , their minions in the media , and Keynesian economic professors who don &apos;t understand and misrepresent Keynes sustain this distorted view .
Europe would be a lot better off if someone told the public the truth .
A Good Year for God
London - It &apos;s been a better year for God .
After withering literary assaults on the Almighty from the Oxford academic Richard Dawkins , the essayist Christopher Hitchens , and others , believers have hit back .
Best of all has been The Case for God by the brilliant religion writer Karen Armstrong .
More important still is the news that more people ( certainly in Britain ) are going to Christian churches of all denominations .
Moreover , the Pope made a very successful visit to Britain in September .
We know already about heavy attendance at the country &apos;s mosques .
At this time of year , of course , many Christians who are not regular churchgoers attend the nativity services .
Carols , church bells , and mangers are still at the heart of mid-winter festivities , alongside the consumer binge .
This year , however , the &quot; big spend &quot; in Europe may have been inhibited by the big winter freeze and the big austerity programs across most of the continent .
Even in the most Godless households , most children in Western societies probably know the details of the Christmas story .
The travelers who can find no room at the inn .
The birth of a baby in the stables .
The arrival of the wise men bearing gifts of gold , frankincense , and myrrh .
We learn about all this at the same time as we are told about Father Christmas , his Lapland reindeers , and his sacks full of presents .
We rapidly lose our belief in that winter myth .
But we tend to retain into adulthood the same views of God that we formed in childhood .
An old man with a long beard watches over us , and most of us retain a pretty literal opinion of the stories about his Son told in the Bible &apos;s New Testament .
It is this God that atheists like Dawkins and Hitchens attack .
And , with such a target , it is not very difficult to poke holes and pile on the ridicule .
Leave aside the fact that you can make an even stronger case against Godlessness - remember the atrocities of atheist totalitarians in the twentieth century - and consider the assault on those whose commitment to literal interpretations of religious texts means that they deny science and reason .
To them the world was made in six days ; evolution is a fanciful tale .
Those of us who think that science and religion dwell in different domains , and who recall that SOCRATES argued that science did not teach you about morality or meaning , find that our case is undermined by the literalists and fundamentalists in every religion .
There are Christians who know all about the fire and brimstone of the Book of Revelation , but seem not to have heard the instructions about generosity in the sermon on the Mount .
Likewise , there are hard-line Jews , such as the settler groups who drive Palestinians from their homes in East Jerusalem and Hebron , who have forgotten the early teachings of Jewish scholars who argued that strangers should be treated like your own people .
And there are Muslims who ignore the Koran &apos;s commands of pluralism , tolerance , and peace .
Where the atheist assault is often correct is in pinpointing the amount of harm frequently done in our world by such fundamentalists .
Right-wing American attitudes about their country &apos;s place in the world are invigorated by fundamentalist dogma .
The United Nations is the devil &apos;s own creation .
President Barack Obama is an un-American Muslim .
Palestine from the Jordan River to the coast should be handed to Israel so that the world can end with a cataclysmic Christian triumph .
Jewish fundamentalists obstruct any peace process that is left in the Middle East and build more illegal settlements .
Islamic fundamentalists define Jihad as a war of terror against the West and call for an Islamic caliphate from the Atlantic to the Pacific .
The strident and damaging dogmatism of fundamentalists of every stripe has a common feature : A truculent sense of grievance , rooted in fear and resentment of modernity .
Christian fundamentalism in America harks back to nineteenth-century populism and anti-intellectualism .
Members of evangelical churches associate their beliefs with the rugged individualism of the early pioneers .
They are contemptuous of the establishment .
Jewish fundamentalists believe that Israel &apos;s critics are anti-Semitic or , in the case of Jewish opponents of Israel &apos;s harder-line policies , &quot; self-hating Jews . &quot;
Islamic fundamentalists reckon that what the rest of us regard as the liberalizing influence of technological progress and globalization is a brash re-run of Western colonialism .
For a happier New Year , we should listen to the core messages of all these great religions , above all the Confucian golden rule that we should never do to others what we would not like to be done to us .
What religion should teach us is not how to hate , but - to borrow again from Confucius - how to develop societies that look after and welcome the poor , the stranger , and the oppressed .
That is the most important message for everyone , atheists included , to take from the Christian story of Christmas .
A Grand Bargain with Iran
The specter of a nuclear Iran haunts Arabs and Israelis alike , but it is the United States and Israel that are the driving force behind efforts to curtail Iran &apos;s nuclear ambitions .
The America-Iran-Israel triangle is where the clue to the problem and its possible solution lie .
Though Ayatollah Khomeini &apos;s Islamic revolution in 1979 disrupted Israel &apos;s old alliance with Iran , the two countries continued to conduct business with America &apos;s blessing .
The Iran-Contra affair of the 1980 &quot; s , through which Israel supplied arms to the Islamic Republic in its war against Iraq is a case in point .
Israel and Iran , two non-Arab powers in a hostile Arab environment , shared fundamental interests that the Islamic revolution could not change .
It was during Yitzhak Rabin &apos;s government in the early 1990 &quot; s that Israel and Iran entered into open conflict , owing to the changing strategic environment after America &apos;s victory in the first Gulf War and the collapse of the Soviet Union .
The US-sponsored Arab-Israeli peace process , which produced a series of breathtaking achievements - the Madrid peace conference , the Oslo accords , Israel &apos;s peace agreement with Jordan , a near-rapprochement with Syria , and Israel &apos;s inroads into Arab states from Morocco to Qatar - was an increasingly isolated Iran &apos;s worst nightmare .
It was at that crossroads that Israel and Iran , two powers vying for mastery in a rapidly changing Middle East , chose to cast their strategic competition in ideological terms .
The conflict was now between Israel , a beacon of democracy fighting the expansion of a Shiite obscurantist empire , and an Iran that chose to protect its revolution by mobilizing the Arab masses in the name of Islamic values and against treacherous rulers who had betrayed the dispossessed Palestinians .
More an enemy of Israeli-Arab reconciliation than of Israel as such , the Mullahs &quot; resort to an incendiary anti-Jewish , pan-Islamic discourse is aimed at ending Iran &apos;s isolation and presenting its regional ambitions in a light palatable to the Sunni masses .
In an Arab Middle East , Iran is the natural enemy ; in an Islamic world , Iran is a potential leader .
Ironically , Iran has been the main supporter of Arab democracy , for the best way to undermine the incumbent regimes is to promote popularly based Islamist movements such as Hezbollah in Lebanon , the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt , Hamas in Palestine , and the Shiite majority in Iraq .
Yitzhak Rabin believed that an Israeli-Arab peace could prevent a nuclear Iran , but now his nightmare seems rapidly approaching .
As an anti-status quo power , Iran is not pursuing nuclear capabilities in order to destroy Israel , but to gain prestige and influence in a hostile environment and as a shield for its challenge to the regional order .
But Israel has every reason to be concerned , for a nuclear Iran would undermine the promise of Zionism to secure a Jewish refuge - the core rationale of Israel &apos;s own strategy of &quot; nuclear ambiguity &quot; - and would embolden its enemies throughout the region .
It would also trigger uncontrolled regional nuclear proliferation , with Saudi Arabia and Egypt leading the way .
A military attack on Iran &apos;s nuclear facilities is too dangerous , and its results uncertain .
And , however severe economic sanctions might be , they might not bring Iran to its knees .
Nor is it clear that the split within the Iranian elite between revolutionary purists and those with a merchant-class mentality would lead to regime change any time soon .
However , being radical does not necessarily mean being irrational , and revolutionary Iran has given frequent proof of its pragmatism .
In the American-Iranian equation it was the US , not Iran , that conducted rigid ideological diplomacy .
Iran backed the US during the first Gulf War , but was left out of the Madrid peace conference .
Iran also supported America in its war to depose the Taliban in Afghanistan .
And , when US forces overran Saddam Hussein &apos;s army in the spring of 2003 , the encircled Iranians proposed a grand bargain that would put all contentious issues on the table , from the nuclear issue to Israel , from Hezbollah to Hamas .
The Iranians also pledged to stop obstructing the Israeli-Arab peace process .
But , neo-conservative haughtiness - &quot; We don &apos;t speak to evil &quot; - ruled out a pragmatic response to Iran &apos;s demarche .
Iran &apos;s mood changed by the time America &apos;s entire Middle East strategy had gone adrift , but the grand bargain remains the only viable way out of the impasse .
This would not be achieved , however , through an inevitably imperfect sanctions regime , or by America &apos;s resort to Cold War logic aimed at breaking Iran &apos;s backbone by drawing it into a ruinous arms race .
Iran &apos;s growing regional influence does not stem from its military expenditures , which are far lower than those of its enemies , but from its challenge to America and Israel through an astute use of soft power .
There is no better way to undercut Iran &apos;s regional strategy of destabilization than a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace , accompanied by massive investments in human development , and followed by an internationally sponsored system of peace and security in a verifiably nuclear-free Middle East , including Israel .
A Gravity Test for the Euro
Cambridge - Although I appreciate that exchange rates are never easy to explain or understand , I find today &apos;s relatively robust value for the euro somewhat mysterious .
Do the gnomes of currency markets seriously believe that the eurozone governments &quot; latest &quot; comprehensive package &quot; to save the euro will hold up for more than a few months ?
The new plan relies on a questionable mix of dubious financial-engineering gimmicks and vague promises of modest Asian funding .
Even the best part of the plan , the proposed ( but not really agreed ) 50 % haircut for private-sector holders of Greek sovereign debt , is not sufficient to stabilize that country &apos;s profound debt and growth problems .
So how is it that the euro is trading at a 40 % premium to the US dollar , even as investors continue to view southern European government debt with great skepticism ?
I can think of one very good reason why the euro needs to fall , and six not-so-convincing reasons why it should remain stable or appreciate .
Let &apos;s begin with why the euro needs to fall .
Absent a clear path to a much tighter fiscal and political union , which can lead only through constitutional change , the current halfway house of the euro system appears increasingly untenable .
It seems clear that the European Central Bank will be forced to buy far greater quantities of eurozone sovereign ( junk ) bonds .
That may work in the short term , but if sovereign default risks materialize - as my research with Carmen Reinhart suggests is likely - the ECB will in turn have to be recapitalized .
And , if the stronger northern eurozone countries are unwilling to digest this transfer - and political resistance runs high - the ECB may be forced to recapitalize itself through money creation .
Either way , the threat of a profound financial crisis is high .
Given this , what arguments support the current value of the euro , or its further rise ?
First , investors might be telling themselves that in the worst-case scenario , the northern European countries will effectively push out the weaker countries , creating a super-euro .
But , while this scenario has a certain ring of truth , surely any breakup would be highly traumatic , with the euro diving before its rump form recovered .
Second , investors may be remembering that even though the dollar was at the epicenter of the 2008 financial panic , the consequences radiated so widely that , paradoxically , the dollar actually rose in value .
Although it may be difficult to connect the dots , it is perfectly possible that a huge euro crisis could have a snowball effect in the US and elsewhere .
Perhaps the transmission mechanism would be through US banks , many of which remain vulnerable , owing to thin capitalization and huge portfolios of mortgages booked far above their market value .
Third , foreign central banks and sovereign wealth funds may be keen to keep buying up euros to hedge against risks to the US and their own economies .
Government investors are not necessarily driven by the return-maximizing calculus that motivates private investors .
If foreign official demand is the real reason behind the euro &apos;s strength , the risk is that foreign sovereign euro buyers will eventually flee , just as private investors would , only in a faster and more concentrated way .
Fourth , investors may believe that , ultimately , US risks are just as large as Europe &apos;s .
True , the US political system seems stymied in coming up with a plan to stabilize medium-term budget deficits .
Whereas the US Congress &apos;s &quot; supercommittee , &quot; charged with formulating a fiscal-consolidation package , will likely come up with a proposal , it is far from clear that either Republicans or Democrats will be willing to accept compromise in an election year .
Moreover , investors might be worried that the US Federal Reserve will weigh in with a third round of &quot; quantitative easing , &quot; which would further drive down the dollar .
Fifth , the current value of the euro does not seem wildly out of line on a purchasing-power basis . &amp; # 160 ; An exchange rate of $ 1.4 : € 1 is cheap for Germany &apos;s export powerhouse , which could probably operate well even with a far stronger euro .
For the eurozone &apos;s southern periphery , however , today &apos;s euro rate is very difficult to manage .
Whereas some German companies persuaded workers to accept wage cuts to help weather the financial crisis , wages across the southern periphery have been marching steadily upwards , even as productivity has remained stagnant .
But , because the overall value of the euro has to be a balance of the eurozone &apos;s north and south , one can argue that 1.4 is within a reasonable range .
Finally , investors might just believe that the eurozone leaders &quot; latest plan will work , even though the last dozen plans have failed .
Abraham Lincoln is credited with saying &quot; You can fool some of the people all of the time , and all of the people some of the time , but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time . &quot; A comprehensive euro fix will surely arrive for some of the countries at some time , but not for all of the countries anytime soon .
So , yes , there are plenty of vaguely plausible reasons why the euro , despite its drawn-out crisis , has remained so firm against the dollar so far .
But don &apos;t count on a stable euro-dollar exchange rate - much less an even stronger euro - in the year ahead .
A Greek Catch-22
Buenos Aires - desperate times bring desperate measures .
The latest package to cope with Greece &apos;s insolvency offers a bond buyback to lighten the country &apos;s debt burden .
In essence , this is a back-door debt restructuring : Europe &apos;s bailout fund , the European Financial Stability Facility ( EFSF ) would lend the money for Greece to buy back its own debt in the secondary market at deep discounts , thereby imposing a loss on private bondholders without the need to declare a default .
A recurrent characteristic of Europe &apos;s debt-crisis debate is a Latin American precedent .
Indeed , many highly indebted countries in Latin America conducted similar debt buybacks in the late 1980 &quot; s .
Bolivia &apos;s 1988 buyback of close to half of its defaulted sovereign debt , an operation funded by international donors , is a classic example .
But the most relevant Latin American experience with debt buybacks is a more recent and far less studied case : Ecuador in 2008 .
President Rafael Correa had been toying with default since the 2006 presidential campaign ( debt repudiation was part of his platform ) , and quickly earned a CCC rating from Fitch .
The reasons invoked by Correa ( legal concerns about how the bonds were issued in the 2000 debt exchange ) were beside the point .
The default threat was a way to depress bond prices in secondary markets , only to buy them back at a discount through the back door .
That task was outsourced to Banco del Pacífico , which bought the soon-to-be-defaulted Ecuadorian paper at 20 cents on the dollar and above - a level low enough for a deep haircut but high enough to fend off &quot; vulture &quot; investors .
To speed things up , after the default was declared in December 2008 , Ecuador completed the buyback with an inverse auction for the remaining bondholders , to be settled in cash - rather than a regular exchange in which the legality of undercover purchases was likely to be questioned .
With the larger part of the outstanding stock in friendly hands , and institutional bondholders pressed to liquidate their positions in the midst of the post-Lehman Brothers selloff , the operation was a success .
This episode offers a few preliminary lessons on debt buybacks .
The first concerns the market response .
Judging from the recent evolution of Ecuadorian bond yields , it appears that markets have not punished Ecuador &apos;s behavior : Ecuador , an oil exporter blessed by the 2009 recovery in oil prices , could have returned to the capital markets shortly after the exchange .
This is particularly notable , given that Ecuador &apos;s was perhaps the first opportunistic default ( triggered by unwillingness , rather than inability , to pay ) in recent history .
The second lesson , and the one most pertinent to Europe now , concerns the crucial role played by the default scenario .
Indeed , almost two years of default threats by Correa were not enough to elicit a deep discount .
Ecuador needed to go all the way to a &quot; credit event &quot; in December 2008 to be able to purchase the bonds at bargain prices .
The premise that only a credible default ensures significant private-sector involvement ( that is , that private bondholders take a real hit ) is apparent when we compare the market-friendly Uruguayan debt exchange in 2003 with the draconian Argentine restructuring of 2005 .
In Uruguay , what the authorities presented as a voluntary transaction produced no nominal haircuts and only minor debt relief ; in Argentina , a four-year debt moratorium was essential to achieving nominal haircuts above 50 % .
So the question arises : How are private bondholders to be convinced to get rid of their Greek bonds at a loss if there is a credible buyer of last resort ?
If Europe credibly volunteered funds to buy back all Greek debt , the Greek risk premium would disappear and private investors would be fully bailed out .
Only the probability of a default - and the goal of avoiding even deeper haircuts - can induce investors to liquidate their positions at a discount .
But the buyback can succeed only if the market perceives it as the last chance before a unilateral debt restructuring .
In other words , a successful buyback is a preamble to default .
Can Greece , with the EFSF &apos;s help , obtain debt relief while avoiding default ?
Small purchases at current panic prices , vulture-fund style , are always possible , but they do not promise substantial debt relief .
Large purchases would drive up prices in the secondary market , defeating the point of the whole operation .
And the opaque Ecuadorian methods are not possible in Europe , both for legal reasons and because a transaction of this size could hardly be disguised or outsourced .
But what if the EFSF were to mimic Banco del Pacífico in a transparent way , say , by setting a threshold spread level above which it would fund buy-backs of any Greek bond in the market ?
Naturally , the spread would automatically converge to the threshold , but how much would be sold ?
Would the EFSF be retiring Greek debt at bargain prices or would it be providing insurance to current bondholders ?
If the threshold spread is set reasonably high in order to achieve a significant discount , the stock of debt retired by the buyback would be marginal .
After all , by capping spreads , the buyback facility would limit the downside risk while providing incentives to hold the bonds and wait for the upside - a good reason , perhaps , to make the facility a temporary offer .
By contrast , if the threshold is set low enough to bring spreads down from panic levels , purchases will be more substantive , but at the expense of reducing considerably the effective haircut on private holders .
A debt buyback is something of a Catch 22 : To succeed in inducing a haircut , it needs to profit from the default fears that it intends to alleviate .
Without Ecuador &apos;s gimmicks , buybacks do not seem to be the solution to Greece &apos;s debt overhang .
A Green Return to European Growth
The Hague - Mitigating climate change is often presented as imposing a trade-off between the economy and the environment .
For too long , the debate has been framed around the concept of &quot; burden-sharing . &quot;
But new analysis by a team from six leading European universities and institutes casts new light on this debate , and shows that Europe can make choices that are in its own best economic and environmental interest .
The analysis contained in our new report , A New Growth Path for Europe - Generating Prosperity and Jobs in the Low-Carbon Economy , is based on a comprehensive assessment of European growth prospects in the aftermath of the financial crisis .
Its publication is timely , because the European Union will decide this year whether to raise its target for greenhouse-gas reduction .
Increasing the current emissions target from -20 % to -30 % by 2020 compared to 1990 would represent an important opportunity to revitalize the European economy - independently of what the rest of the world did in terms of climate policy .
Over the coming decade , seizing that opportunity would increase the size of Europe &apos;s economy considerably - by up to 5 % over the next decade .
This translates into six million new jobs and an increase in GDP of up to € 800 billion by 2020 .
The reason for these results is straightforward : Increasing Europe &apos;s climate-policy efforts boosts investments , thus inducing learning-by-doing , especially when these efforts are channeled into new technologies like renewable energy and advanced construction materials .
Learning-by-doing , in turn , increases competitiveness and spurs economic growth , thereby improving investors &quot; expectations - and inducing further investment .
Unfortunately , studies of the economic impact of a -30 % target have relied on traditional equilibrium models that neglect these multiplier effects .
Their estimates of the economic consequences of raising the target result in moderate additional costs , ranging from 0-2 % of GDP in 2020 .
The new study uses an approach similar to that underpinning Germany &apos;s 2020 emissions-reduction target of -40 % .
At last year &apos;s United Nations-sponsored climate-change conference in Cancún , Mexico , German Federal Environment Minister Norbert Röttgen noted that , &quot; In Germany , there has been a shift in thinking over the past years : In industry , politics , and society , we now see climate policy as an opportunity and challenge , not as a threat . &quot;
Röttgen is right .
Imagine a gathering of textile entrepreneurs in 1800 debating whether to introduce steam machines to mechanize their cotton mills .
One of them calculates that the costs would be prohibitive across their hundreds of plants .
If the rest accepted this bottom-up calculation , society would miss out on the 0.5 % boost to annual growth that this radical innovation ultimately brought about .
The benefit to the entire economy was bigger than the sum of the benefits for the individual mills .
It was not the invention of the steam engine alone that deserves the credit .
Then as now , such breakthroughs generate a cascade of learning and innovation as suppliers , contractors. and customers adapt to a new way of operating .
Every new major technological idea - the steam engine , railways , or the personal computer - adds up to a boost to growth .
A New Growth Path for Europe shows how investing in energy efficiency and clean energy has the same potential to revitalize Europe today .
Indeed , Josef Ackermann , Chairman of Deutsche Bank , recently said that such investments augur &quot; a new industrial revolution - a revolution that will transform the way we live . &quot;
The analysis shows how all major economic sectors - including many energy-intensive industries - will grow .
For example , energy-efficient buildings are a boon to the cement and chemical industries .
Obviously , the fossil-fuel sector would shrink by 2020 as the energy system decarbonizes , with coal being partly displaced by lower-carbon fuels , mainly gas and renewables ( carbon capture and storage and nuclear power cannot make much of a difference by 2020 ) .
The new EU member states , which have lower energy efficiency , stand to benefit the most - though substantial hurdles must be overcome with additional support mechanisms .
Because the financial crisis has lowered greenhouse-gas emissions , the -20 % reduction target set before the crisis is no longer challenging enough to catalyze a structural shift in the European economy .
And , as scientists become gloomier and underline the urgency of tackling climate change , economists are becoming increasingly optimistic about the opportunities implied by a low-carbon future .
A New Growth Path for Europe supports that optimism , and it calls on the EU to act accordingly .
An Arab Marshall Plan
Oxford - The wave of revolts that swept across the Arab world two years ago were fueled by demands for freedom , bread , and social justice .
But , although the revolutions toppled dictators and transformed societies , these core objectives remain as distant as ever .
In fact , the economic challenges facing the Arab Spring countries have become even more pressing , weighing heavily on these countries &quot; political prospects .
Unemployment has nearly doubled in Tunisia and Egypt , and foreign direct investment has dried up across the Arab world .
Tourism revenues , while resilient , are declining , and fiscal challenges remain considerable .
But the economic urgency is not reflected in the policy response , which has been painfully slow or non-existent .
For example , Egypt &apos;s fiscal deficit will exceed 11 % of GDP this year .
But the country &apos;s leaders have been stalling on the terms of a much-needed International Monetary Fund loan .
The government &apos;s reduction of fuel subsidies last year was not followed by additional reforms , and the required tax increase was delayed soon after President Mohamed Morsi announced it .
Almost all political stakeholders in Egypt , as in the other Arab countries in transition , recognize the need for economic reform .
But neither citizens nor policymakers appear willing to bear its social and political costs .
In a charged and uncertain political climate , in which new crises erupt on a daily basis , it is unsurprising that economic reform has been postponed repeatedly .
Politicians know that macroeconomic stabilization and social cohesion can be irreconcilable in the short run .
Slashing food and energy subsidies in order to reduce fiscal strain is unlikely to win favor in a country like Egypt , where 40 % of per capita income is allocated to food .
Politics is thus constraining efforts to strengthen public finances .
At the same time , narrow IMF prescriptions threaten to exacerbate political instability , with citizens no longer afraid to take to the streets to demonstrate their dissatisfaction .
The current impasse on economic reform highlights a larger point : Subsidy and tax regimes cannot be reformed without first redefining the underlying social contract , which has long exchanged welfare distribution for political acquiescence .
But such a move is far too risky for an individual politician , or even a single country , at a time of economic uncertainty and high unemployment .
In order to create the political space needed for economic reform , Arab leaders must underwrite a regional growth pact - a Marshall Plan of sorts - that would facilitate major new investments aimed at reviving economic activity .
It is much easier to reform subsidy programs when the economy is expanding .
Moreover , building competitive markets is essential to ensuring sustainable GDP growth .
To this end , regional trade barriers , which are more pervasive in the Arab world than even in Sub-Saharan Africa , must be dismantled .
By agreeing to the pact , Arab countries would commit to reforming their subsidy systems and to reducing restrictions on cross-border economic exchange .
The regional dimension of prosperity has long been ignored in the Arab world .
But weak regional linkages limit small firms &quot; growth potential , forcing them to depend on state patronage .
Although Arab leaders often cite Turkey as a beacon of hope , they rarely acknowledge that the country &apos;s recent transformation from the &quot; sick man of Europe &quot; to one of the world &apos;s fastest-growing emerging markets would not have been possible had it not pursued regional synergies .
Such linkages are particularly important for Egypt and Tunisia , which will struggle to reduce unemployment unless Libya &apos;s labor market - which has historically absorbed migrants from its North African neighbors - is reopened .
And , while Tunisia &apos;s situation seems to be the most promising , a crippling investment shortfall is threatening to derail reform efforts there .
With Europe mired in crisis , capital flows from Tunisia &apos;s resource-rich Arab neighbors are its best hope .
Furthermore , Arab countries must ratchet up development spending .
Given that existing development banks in the region have largely failed to act as vehicles of coordination and commitment , a new institution - resembling the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development - would have to be established to oversee a regional aid push and underwrite the costs of economic transition .
New investment vehicles , such as sovereign wealth funds and Islamic finance , can contribute financing to credit-starved firms .
At the same time , Arab countries must streamline current aid efforts .
For too long , Arab governments have simply thrown money at problems , with the rich Gulf countries effectively subsidizing their troubled neighbors &quot; public services .
Over the last two years , Saudi Arabia has provided more than $ 3 billion to Yemen . Qatar has provided &amp; # 160 ; $ 5 billion to Egypt since 2011 , with a promise of $ 3 billion more .
And the United Arab Emirates recently pledged $ 2.5 billion to Bahrain .
But unconditional aid only delays reforms , because it weakens budget constraints , which reduces pressure on policymakers and creates moral hazard .
The Arab Spring has exposed fault lines that run not just through individual countries , but also through the entire region .
This calls for redefining relationships not only between citizens and states , but also among Arab countries .
Above all , it is no longer prudent to divide Arab countries between donors and recipients , or between resource-rich and resource-poor countries .
It is in the interest of the entire region - including those countries that do not seem to face an imminent threat of revolt - to contribute to their neighbors &quot; economic revival and facilitate their political transitions .
Atlanta &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; The world is witnessing a terrible human rights crime in Gaza , where a million and a half human beings are being imprisoned with almost no access to the outside world by sea , air , or land . An entire population is being brutally punished .
This gross mistreatment of the Palestinians in Gaza was escalated dramatically by Israel , with United States backing , after political candidates representing Hamas won a majority of seats in the Palestinian Authority parliament in 2006 .
The election was unanimously judged to be honest and fair by all international observers .
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; Israel and the US refused to accept the right of Palestinians to form a unity government with Hamas and Fatah and now , after internal strife , Hamas alone controls Gaza . Forty-one of the 43 victorious Hamas candidates who lived in the West Bank are now imprisoned by Israel , plus an additional ten who assumed positions in the short-lived coalition cabinet .
Regardless of one &apos;s choice in the partisan struggle between Fatah and Hamas within occupied Palestine , we must remember that economic sanctions and restrictions in delivering water , food , electricity , and fuel are causing extreme hardship among the innocent people in Gaza , about one million of whom are refugees .
Israeli bombs and missiles periodically strike the encapsulated area , causing high casualties among both militants and innocent women and children .
Prior to the highly publicized killing of a woman and her four little children last week , this pattern was illustrated by a previous report from B &apos;Tselem , the leading Israeli human rights organization : 106 Palestinians were killed between February 27 and March 3 .
Fifty-four of them were civilians who didn &apos;t take part in the fighting , and 25 were under 18 years of age .
On a recent trip through the Middle East , I attempted to gain a better understanding of the crisis .
One of my visits was to Sderot , a community of about 20,000 in southern Israel that is frequently struck by rudimentary rockets fired from nearby Gaza .
I condemned these attacks as abominable and an act of terrorism , since most of the thirteen victims during the past seven years have been non-combatants .
Subsequently , I met with leaders of Hamas , both a delegation from Gaza and the top officials in Damascus , Syria .
I made the same condemnation to them , and urged that they declare a unilateral ceasefire or orchestrate with Israel a mutual agreement to terminate all military action in and around Gaza for an extended period .
They responded that such previous action by them had not been reciprocated , and they reminded me that Hamas had previously insisted on a ceasefire throughout Palestine including both Gaza and the West Bank , which Israel had refused .
Hamas then made a public proposal of a mutual ceasefire restricted to Gaza , which the Israelis considered and also rejected .
There are fervent arguments heard on both sides concerning blame for a lack of peace in the Holy Land .
Israel has occupied and colonized the Palestinian West Bank , which is approximately one-fourth ( 28.5 % ) the size of the nation of Israel as recognized by the international community .
Some Israeli religious factions claim a right to the land on both sides of the Jordan River , and others aver that their 205 settlements with some 500,000 people are necessary for &quot; security . &quot;
All Arab nations have agreed to full recognition of Israel if it will comply with key United Nations resolutions .
Hamas has agreed to accept any negotiated peace settlement between Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , provided it is approved in a referendum among the Palestinian people .
This holds promise of progress , but despite the brief fanfare and positive statements at the peace conference last November in Annapolis , Maryland , a retrogression has occurred in the process .
Nine thousand new Israeli settlement housing units have been announced in Palestine , the number of roadblocks within the West bank has increased , and the stranglehold on Gaza has been tightened .
It is one thing for other leaders to defer to the US on the crucial peace negotiations , but the world must not stand idle while innocent people are treated cruelly .
It is time for strong voices in Europe , the US , Israel , and elsewhere to speak out and condemn this human rights tragedy among the Palestinian people .
A Hundred Weltpolitiks
New Delhi - Mao Zedong once famously called for the Chinese to &quot; let a hundred flowers bloom . &quot;
Soon , however , he was recoiling from what he saw as a chaos of competing ideas .
Today , the world seems to be entering a period when , if not a hundred , at least a dozen varieties of Weltpolitik are being pursued by great and emerging powers alike .
Reconciling these competing strategic visions of the world , in particular of global crisis , will make international diplomacy more complicated than ever .
The intervention by Turkey and Brazil into the globally divisive issue of Iran &apos;s nuclear program is but the latest , and also the clearest , sign of this new element in global affairs .
In May , the Iranian , Turkish , and Brazilian leaders met in Tehran to conclude an agreement that would supposedly have Iran deposit 1,200 kilograms of lightly enriched uranium ( Leu ) in Turkey , which , in exchange , would send 120 kilograms of enriched fuel to be used in Iran &apos;s research reactor .
Russia proposed this kind of swap earlier , but Iran declined the offer , and the version agreed with Brazil and Turkey was likewise intended to forestall Iran &apos;s ability to produce highly enriched uranium ( HEU ) , which can be used for nuclear warheads .
But its other intention was probably to stymie American efforts to adopt new United Nations sanctions on Iran .
It is too soon to tell if Iran &apos;s desire to obtain nuclear weapons has been delayed .
The International Atomic Energy Agency has not ruled against the agreement , and I am informed that the Brazilian / Turkish brokered deal does not violate the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , to which Iran , as a signatory , is obliged to adhere .
Nevertheless , the effort to preempt American strategy clearly failed , as new UN sanctions were implemented earlier this month .
As the deal was intended to avoid a nuclear standoff with Iran , why was there so much outrage in the US and the West ?
I fear it is because the US found itself denied its primacy in setting global policy on Iran .
Instead of trying to explore the possibilities presented by the Brazilian / Turkish opening , the US quickly pushed the UN Security Council for more sanctions ( the fourth round so far ) on Iran .
This forced Brazil and Turkey , both currently non-permanent members of the Security Council , to vote against the sanctions resolution .
The result ?
This vital vote was robbed of unanimity ( Lebanon also opposed it ) .
The UN sanction vote was also heavily influenced by another small country with a Weltpolitik : Israel .
In February , a high-level Israeli delegation visited Beijing to present the Chinese leadership with &quot; evidence &quot; of Iran &apos;s atomic ambitions .
The Israelis then explained to their hosts - in considerable detail - the potential economic consequences for China if an Israeli strike on Iran should become necessary in order to stop Iran from fulfilling its &quot; nuclear ambitions . &quot;
China appears to have taken the message to heart , as it voted in favor of sanctions on Iran for the first time .
Iran responded by calling China &apos;s vote &quot; two faced . &quot;
The emerging stew of Weltpolitik thickened even more with Israel &apos;s pre-emptive move in international waters to stop a flotilla supposedly bringing relief aid to blockaded Gaza .
For it was on a Turkish flagged ship that Israeli forces killed nine people , causing a near-rupture in Israeli-Turkish relations .
To be sure , this complex web of interconnected events reflects the declining global role of the US .
But it also demonstrates the robust assertion of national interest by new players on the global scene .
Brazil , Turkey , and , yes , Iran are all clearly keen to demonstrate their political and foreign-policy independence .
Brazil wants to prove that it deserves a permanent seat on the Security Council .
Turkey seeks to re-establish its Islamic identity and &quot; Ottoman &quot; influence over the Middle East , thereby flexing its diplomatic muscles for a European Union that has all but rejected Turkish membership .
And Iran simply wants to show once again that it will not kowtow to the &quot; Great Satan . &quot;
All of these motivations critically challenge US global diplomatic primacy .
But America had better get used to these types of diplomatic cat &apos;s cradles .
For there are other powers , both emerging and established , with global foreign policies of their own - India , Indonesia , Japan .
And regional players like South Africa , Nigeria , Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Indonesia , and South Korea among others , will also have to be reckoned with in future regional disputes .
This increasingly complex web of intersecting national interests is the face of international diplomacy in the twenty-first century .
Ancient rivalries and atavistic feuds may or may not be part of this ; only future crisis will tell .
But this amalgam of competing strategic visions probably marks the end of America &apos;s post-Cold War power .
With the entire world affected by turmoil in the Persian Gulf and greater Middle East , perhaps that is all to the good . Surely , the national interests of the US and the West are not the only ones that matter .
Why , then , should the rest of the world leave the resolution of these disputes to America alone ?
The era of US diplomatic hegemony has drawn to a close .
And it would be a grave mistake to think that a condominium between the US and China will impose global order in the way that the Cold War-era US / USSR superpower rivalry did .
Too many powerful countries now feel able to flex their diplomatic muscles in defense of their interests .
Mao &apos;s hundred flowers may have bloomed only briefly , but today &apos;s myriad species of Weltpolitik are certain to bloom perennially .
A Japanese metamorphosis ?
Osaka - Yesterday &apos;s landslide general-election victory by the Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) terminated the one-party-dominated system that the catch-all Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) has controlled almost without interruption since 1955 .
For most of the last decade , the DPJ was not seen as a viable alternative to the LDP , although they appeared to form a pseudo-two-party system .
Twenty years after the Cold War &apos;s end , Japan will at last have a post-Cold War system of government .
The Japanese public , even now , remains uncertain about the DPJ &apos;s ability to govern and is skeptical of its rosy programs of wealth redistribution , which lack solid funding .
The public is also fully aware that the ideologically fragmented DPJ lacks a pragmatic , coherent foreign and security policy
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; Yet the DPJ will form the next government because of public disgust with the LDP .
For the last four years , the LDP had shown itself to be utterly unresponsive to the key issues of popular concern : Pensions , unemployment , and the fraying social safety net .
Moreover , the LDP was plagued by a string of minor scandals and consistent bungling .
The LDP &apos;s need for three different prime ministers in the space of little more than a year made plain that the party &apos;s power nucleus had melted down .
Once in power , the DPJ will immediately confront the massive bureaucracy and entrenched mandarins , which usually sabotage any efforts at administrative reform that threatens their power and vested interests .
Indeed , immediately after the election , the budget estimates for the next fiscal year are due .
The figures that will be presented are the result of a lengthy process , in which the bureaucracy closely consulted with LDP .
So , without breaking the regular budget cycle , the DPJ will be forced to implement not only the supplementary budget drawn up by the LDP , but will also be stuck with next year &apos;s budget , which embodies LDP policies that the DPJ has denounced .
As a result , the DPJ has announced plans to revoke the LDP &apos;s guidelines for a ceiling on budget requests so as to formulate its own budget from scratch . It will also revise the supplementary budget as well .
But time is short , and few of new DPJ lawmakers possess the legislative experience and budgetary expertise to make that happen .
To gain control of the mandarins , the DPJ plans to place 100 lawmakers in the ministries &quot; top leadership , as well as three dozen political appointees to policy staffs in the office of the prime minister .
Unfortunately , the DPJ scrapped an LDP-sponsored civil-service reform bill , which would have allowed the DPJ to replace mandarins with an army of political appointees .
The DPJ , despite its manifesto , seems unprepared to tame the mandarins , and so may be forced to rely on them .
The ascendency of the mandarins is a legacy of Japan &apos;s unique historical development dating back to its early modern period .
Unlike in Europe , Japan developed its state before building a strong civil society .
Indeed , full-fledged &quot; society &quot; -Building started only after the 1868 Meiji Restoration , which tipped the balance of power definitively in favor of the state .
As a result , the mandarins survived WWII and the postwar American occupation relatively undamaged , and they will strive to survive the DPJ government as well .
They will most likely succeed .
LDP lawmakers and mandarins developed a routine in which mandarins drafted cabinet-sponsored bills , LDP lawmakers checked the bills , and the two together finalized legislative drafts before they were introduced to the Diet ( parliament ) .
Since the LDP , recently with a coalition partner , controlled the Diet , the legislative process was simply the interaction between LDP lawmakers and mandarins , centered in the LDP &apos;s headquarters .
The Diet &apos;s role was merely pro forma .
Indeed , under the LDP-led one-party-dominant system , this extra-constitutional mechanism became an integral part of Japan &apos;s government polity .
The DPJ government will collide head-on with the mandarins , partly because the party will find it hard to recruit sufficiently qualified policymakers .
The mandarins have maintained their privileged position in this regard , owing partly to the tax system , which prevents the emergence of non-profit institutions , especially think tanks , where independent policy expertise can be forged .
Moreover , perhaps in anticipation of a change in power , the mandarins have moved forward the annual personnel changes in the major ministries &quot; top administrative positions .
And what of the LDP ?
Having fallen from power , it will lose its control of the redistribution of government funds .
Unable to pay off its constituencies , disintegration looms , for the LDP has never been a party with entrenched grass-roots support , but instead operates as a machine of power and redistribution through a web of insiders across the country &apos;s industrial sectors , occupational associations , and local communities .
Only by recruiting new blood and reorganizing itself with a solid ideological platform will an LDP comeback be possible .
The DPJ has even weaker grass-roots support , so the mandarins will most likely use their standard techniques of divide and rule to cajole the party by teaching it to mimic the LDP in using state money and contracts to underwrite its major constituencies , such as labor unions and other interest groups .
The birth of the DPJ government can yet be a turning point .
A major power shift in favor of &quot; society &quot; has taken place .
If the DPJ can break free of Mandarin control by centralizing policy formation in the office of the prime minister , as it intends , Japan can emerge as a more resilient democracy with a full-fledged two-party system and greater willingness to assume an international leadership role .
A jobless Recovery ?
Cambridge - Who will suffer the longest and the most from the implosion in 2008-2009 of Wall Street and the ensuing world recession ?
Not the bankers and financiers who created the disaster .
Some financiers , like Bernard Madoff , will go to prison for fraud .
But , although Madoff was only the tip of the iceberg of rampant financial malfeasance , most suspect financiers need not fear arrest , either because their behavior merely skirted the law , or because financial impropriety more subtle than outright fraud is often difficult to prove .
Some bank bosses will retire in shame , but with huge payments to ease their pain - such as the $ 55 million golden parachute handed to Bank of America &apos;s Ken Lewis , with his , and the £ 25 million pension bestowed on Royal Bank of Scotland &apos;s Fred Godwin .
But , buoyed by government bailout money , guarantees , and low interest rates , many banks have again begun to pay their top managers huge bonuses while fighting vigorously against reforms designed to restrain their risk-taking and compensation .
The big losers from this economic disaster are workers in the advanced countries that bought into the laissez-faire flexibility of American-style capitalism .
From 2007 to October 2009 , the United States lost nearly eight million jobs , which reduced the employment-population ratio from 63 % to 58.5 % .
The unemployment rate at the end of 2009 was above 10 % , duration of joblessness was the longest since the Great Depression , millions had had their working hours cut , and millions more were too discouraged by a lack of jobs to seek work .
Advanced Europe , Canada , and Japan also suffered major job losses that will last for a long time .
Spain , which allows for widespread temporary contracts , has had the biggest increase in unemployment , because Spanish workers can be fired as quickly as those in the US .
Some countries - for example , Germany , Sweden , and South Korea - have &quot; hidden &quot; their joblessness by paying firms to keep workers on the payroll . This can work in the short term , but it cannot be sustained over time .
From the 1980 &quot; s through the mid-2000 &quot; s , employment has increasingly lagged GDP in economic recoveries .
In the US , there was a jobless recovery under President Bill Clinton until the dot.com boom in the latter part of the 1990 &quot; s , and there was a jobless recovery under George W. Bush in the wake of the 2001 slowdown .
In the early 1990 &quot; s , Sweden suffered a huge recession precipitated by a housing bubble and a banking crisis .
Its unemployment rate rose from 1.8 % in 1990 to 9.6 % in 1994 , before bottoming out at 5 % in 2001 .
Sixteen years after the crisis , the unemployment rate was 6.2 % - more than triple the rate in 1990 .
In 1997 , Korea suffered not only from the Asian financial crisis , but also from insistence by the US and the International Monetary Fund that it raise interest rates and undertake &quot; Washington Consensus &quot; -style reforms to receive aid .
Employment recovered , but primarily in &quot; non-regular &quot; jobs with limited benefits , low wages , and little job security .
Inequality in Korea rose from moderate levels to second highest ( behind the US ) among advanced OECD countries .
Weakness in the job market takes a huge toll on economic and personal well-being .
Young people seeking their first jobs and experienced workers who lose jobs in a weak job market suffer economic losses that will last their entire lives .
Studies of happiness show that unemployment reduces happiness by as much as the loss of a family member .
It is difficult to see the US re-attaining full employment anytime soon .
From 1993 to 1998 , the US created millions of jobs , which raised the employment rate by 5.4 percentage points .
If employment began rising at this rate in 2010 , it would take until 2015 before it reached its pre-recession level .
And slow recovery in the US will drag down recovery in other advanced countries , reducing their employment as well .
A long , painful period of high unemployment runs counter to what most experts believed the flexible US economic model would ever produce .
From the early 1990 &quot; s on , many analysts viewed America &apos;s weak unionization , at-will employment , limited legal job protection , and high job turnover as major factors in achieving a lower unemployment rate than most EU countries .
Many OECD countries initiated various kinds of flexibility reforms in the hope of improving their economies along US lines .
The view that flexibility is the key factor in employment is no longer tenable .
In its 2009 Employment Outlook , the OECD took a hard look at its favored policy reforms and found them deficient in helping countries adjust to a finance-driven recession .
According to the OECD , &quot; there does not appear to be any strong reason to expect that recent structural reforms mean that OECD labor markets are now substantially less sensitive to severe economic downturns . &quot;
So the lesson from the recession is clear .
The weak reed in capitalism is not the labor market , but the financial market .
At worst , labor-market failures impose modest inefficiency costs on society , whereas capital-market failures harm society greatly , with workers , rather than the perpetrators of financial disaster , suffering the most .
Moreover , globalization means that the US capital market &apos;s failure spreads misery around the world .
We owe it to workers victimized by this recession to reinvent finance so that it works to enrich the real economy , instead of enriching only the financiers .
This means changing the incentives and rules that govern the financial sector .
Since other countries &quot; economies and jobs are also at stake , they owe it to their citizens to press the US to deliver meaningful financial reforms .
France &apos;s Midsummer Night &apos;s Dream
Paris - Bastille Day , the French national holiday , was glorious this year .
The military parade , dominated by the celebration of &quot; victory &quot; in Mali and the joint participation of African and United Nations troops , had the perfection of a gracious , albeit muscular , ballet .
The classical concert that preceded the magisterial fireworks that ended the day was the closest thing to a French version of the Proms in London , mixing light classical and popular songs . The Eiffel Tower imbued the evening with its magic .
Paris , in case anyone had any lingering doubts , remains the capital of the world - or so it seemed for a night .
The melancholia that began to seize France many years ago was all but forgotten .
The celebration of the glory of the past , mixed with popular English songs of the present , seemed to indicate renewed national confidence .
What was the meaning of this moment of grace ?
Was it purely the product of a collective delusion , an emotional Potemkin village of sorts , encouraged , if not conceived , by the authorities to restore some level of self-assurance among France &apos;s depressed citizens ?
Even if the positive emotions remain only fleeting ( as seems most likely ) , they were real and palpable .
The French seemed to be in the mood to celebrate .
Of course , it could simply have been the weather ; a gorgeous summer has finally settled in after a miserable spring .
But it might also have been one of those natural turning points , a collective and spontaneous decision to say : &quot; Enough of depression , let &apos;s move on . &quot; We French may not be what we used to be , the celebrants seemed to be saying , but we are still much more than people think we are .
We have a great revolutionary past that still conveys universal values - liberty , equality , fraternity - and an army that , as in Mali , continues to make a difference in the world .
One can draw two lessons from this collective form of Escapism .
The first is that , beyond the many layers of depression and distrust in France , there is potential for a new and collective departure .
This would require , of course , less cynical political elites who can transcend their petty ambitions and divisions for the sake of the country .
The second lesson , even more obvious , is that reality cannot be changed with a simple public spectacle .
France is not Imperial Rome , where panem et circenses made a fundamental difference .
It is a weakened democracy mired in an economic and social crisis so deep that it verges on becoming an identity crisis .
The proof was provided by a third traditional event on Bastille Day , between the morning &apos;s military parade and the evening &apos;s music and fireworks : President François Hollande &apos;s speech to the nation , which took the form of an interview with two prominent journalists .
He , too , was in a reassuring mood .
According to Hollande , the economic upturn - la reprise - had just started , and hope was around the corner .
His tone and message had changed .
He was no longer the &quot; normal man &quot; of his election campaign and tenure until now ; instead , he tried to present himself , like his predecessor , Nicolas Sarkozy , as a Superhero .
Of course , given his personality and low public-approval ratings , his address was the least convincing event of the day .
Who could have said with certainty that the economic upturn announced by Hollande was real rather than aspirational ?
Beyond his message &apos;s wishful thinking , the public &apos;s reaction to the messenger was a mixture of disbelief and indifference .
Seeing the behavior of friends , all French , listening with me to Hollande , I was reminded of another moment .
It was December 31 , 1989 , and I was in the Soviet Union .
I had found myself in a restaurant in the old city of Suzdal , listening to President Mikhail Gorbachev &apos;s &quot; New Year wishes . &quot;
I was moved : The man who symbolized glasnost and perestroika , who had allowed the peaceful emancipation of most of Eastern and Central Europe , was speaking .
But I was alone in paying attention to him .
The restaurant &apos;s customers , like my French friends now , could not have cared less .
Their president had become background noise .
Has Hollande become , in this sense , a French Gorbachev ?
For the left and the Greens , he is close to being a traitor .
These voters chose him a year ago not only because he was not Sarkozy , but because he incarnated the values of the true left , even if his centrist moderation seemed a bad omen .
Voters of the center or even the center-right are disappointed , too , by their president &apos;s lack of charisma , if not sheer incompetence .
After a year of Hollande , France is witnessing a fundamental political revolution .
During the half-century of the Fifth Republic , a bipartisan system of left and right has traditionally prevailed .
But now France is becoming a country dominated by a &quot; tripartite system &quot; of more or less equal strength : The left , the right , and the extreme right .
If France wants to capitalize on the positive emotions of Bastille Day , it needs much more responsible elites , ready to unite in the fight against unemployment and its causes ( lack of competitiveness and labor-market rigidity ) and consequences ( the rise of populist , non-republican forces ) .
What Bastille Day revealed , even briefly and superficially , is that the potential to unite France exists .
But doing so requires more than shallow promises .
A Kick-Off for Peace ?
Yerevan - Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan &apos;s recent invitation to Turkish President Abdullah Gul to visit Yerevan to watch a football match together was historic .
Given the two countries &quot; long-strained relations , this visit would have been remarkable at any time .
But coming as it does only one month after the alarming Russian-Georgian confrontation , it may offer real hope that tensions in the volatile Caucasus region can be eased .
Of course , ancient and difficult issues divide Armenia and Turkey .
But now is the moment for both countries to put the past aside in order to address their common security concerns .
In the new context set by the war in Georgia , the urgency of Turkey becoming a real bridge between the nations of the Caucasus is not lost on anyone .
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; This expectation is an inevitable consequence of Turkey &apos;s geography and history .
Situated figuratively between modernity and tradition , secularism and Islam , and democracy and tyranny , Turkey also is an actual physical bridge between East and West .
For the peoples of the Caucasus , Turkey marks our path to Europe .
It is a NATO member , bordering the three Caucasus republics that have NATO Individual Partnership Action Programs .
It aspires to join the European Union , and would bring the EU to our three borders , even as we , too , aspire to join one day .
Indeed , Turkey has never missed an opportunity to present itself as a regional broker .
Immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union , Turkey proposed the Black Sea Economic Cooperation .
This year , as the American-led effort to mediate a Middle East peace settlement began to falter , Turkey took up the job of mediator in both the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the conflict between Syria and Israel .
Now , in the immediate wake of the Russia-Georgia crisis , Turkey &apos;s leaders have stepped forward once again to take a leadership role in the Caucasus .
The world must fervently hope that the Turkish proposal for a Caucasus Stability and Cooperation Platform is more serious and sustained than previous similar efforts .
But , in order to succeed , Turkey must firmly pursue a pledge from all the region &apos;s players to repudiate the use of force in settling their disputes .
If this pledge is adopted and respected , conflicts in the region will be viewed in a wholly different , more tolerant context , marking a historic breakthrough to peace .
In fact , why not take the idea of such a pact one step further ?
We in this region can , and I believe should , call for a non-aligned Caucasus , free of security blocs and adversarial alliances .
After all , security alliances and guarantees only create dividing lines , with their attendant security challenges .
Our countries and peoples have , throughout history , lived under a common umbrella for far longer than we have been divided .
Today , we share a common vision of European integration , and it is in this broader context that our conflicts should be resolved .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy &apos;s and German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s visits to Georgia and Russia proved that there is no substitute for Europe insofar as the Caucasus is concerned .
Only Europe can play the role of honest broker in the region &apos;s atmosphere of suspicion and intolerance .
But , at the end of the day , we ourselves must be willing to work toward a region of peace and cooperation .
The Caucasus is too small a space for closed borders and explosive conflicts .
Although some of those tensions appear purely bilateral , the Georgian-Russian conflict demonstrates that there is no such thing anymore in this globalized world , and certainly not in this interconnected region .
In fact , real peace in the Caucasus requires two key strategic transformations .
One is a lesson from history : Russia &apos;s strategic interests here cannot be ignored .
To believe and behave otherwise would lead to regional chaos .
The other lesson is that Turkey and Armenia cannot remain adversaries forever .
There must be normalization in our relations in order for the Caucasus to coalesce into a functional region .
Ironically , both Russia and the United States recognize that this is in their interest .
The Russians view normal relations between Turkey and Armenia as a way to minimize Georgia &apos;s strategic role in the region .
The US views an opening to Turkey as a way to decrease Armenia &apos;s real and imagined reliance on Russia .
Beyond the emotional impact of President Gul &apos;s visit to Yerevan , real improvement in Turkish-Armenian relations requires opening the two countries &quot; closed border - the last in Europe .
Or , for a start , the existing railroad link between the two countries could be made operational .
If this does not happen within the coming weeks and months , then Turkey will have demonstrated that all this was just a show .
President Gul &apos;s visit does mark a watershed - either as a failure to make history , or as the beginning of a new era .
A Lasting Poison
New YORK - Next year will mark the twentieth anniversary of the collapse of communism in Europe .
Liberated from the complexity of knowing too much about the cruel past , the young people of Eastern Europe &apos;s post-communist generation seem uninterested in what their parents and grandparents endured .
Yet the recent revelation of the Czech writer Milan Kundera &apos;s presumed complicity in the face of Stalinism is but the latest of the long half-life of a toxic past .
Other examples come to mind : The accusations of collaboration with the secret police raised against Lech Walesa , Romania &apos;s public controversies surrounding Mircea Eliade &apos;s fascist past , and the attacks on the alleged &quot; Jewish monopoly of suffering &quot; which equate the Holocaust with the Soviet Gulag .
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; Friedrich Nietzsche said that if you look in the eye of the Devil for too long , you risk becoming a devil yourself .
A Bolshevik anticommunism , similar in its dogmatism to communism itself , has from time to time run riot in parts of Eastern Europe .
In country after country , that Manichean mindset , with its oversimplifications and manipulations , was merely re-fashioned to serve the new people in power .
Opportunism has had its share in this , of course .
In 1945 , when the Red Army occupied Romania , the Communist Party had no more than 1,000 members ; in 1989 , it had almost four million .
One day after Nicolae Ceausescu &apos;s execution , most of these people suddenly became fierce anticommunists and victims of the system they had served for decades .
Residual traces of totalitarian thinking can also be found in the hostility to former dissidents like Adam Michnik or Václav Havel , both of whom argued that the new democracies should not exploit resentments or seek revenge , as the totalitarian state did , but instead build a new national consensus to structure and empower a genuine civil society .
Former generals of the secret police and members of the Communistnomenklatura , untouchable in their comfortable villas and retirements , must derive great pleasure from watching today &apos;s witch hunts and manipulation of old files for immediate political purposes .
But the case of Kundera appears different - though no less disturbing .
In 1950 , Kundera , then a 20-year-old Communist , reportedly denounced to the criminal police as a Western spy a man he had never met - a friend of his friend &apos;s girlfriend .
The man was later brutally interrogated in a former Gestapo torture facility and spent 14 years in prison .
Kundera &apos;s name was contained in the investigating officer &apos;s report , which was authenticated after a respected historian discovered it in a dusty Prague archive .
The reclusive Kundera , who immigrated to Paris in 1975 , has declared that &quot; it never happened . &quot;
Moreover , Czechoslovakia &apos;s fearsome secret police , who had every interest in silencing or compromising the famous dissident writer , never used the incident to blackmail or expose him .
Until more information is forthcoming , both from Kundera and from the authorities , the case will not be solved &quot; beyond reasonable doubt . &quot;
Butif it happened , the case calls for a deeper reflection .
As far as we know , Kundera never was an informer before or after this incident , and we cannot ignore that he later freed himself from the compulsory totalitarian happiness that communism propagated .
Indeed , his case also serves as a reminder that the early 1950 &quot; s was the most brutal period of &quot; proletarian dictatorship &quot; in Eastern Europe - a period of great enthusiasm and terrible fear that poisoned the minds and souls of devoted believers , fierce opponents , and apathetic bystanders alike .
Moreover , Kundera &apos;s case is hardly unique .
In 2006 , the Nobel Prize-winning German author Günter Grass &apos;s disclosed that , 60 years earlier , he was , as a teenager , a member of the Waffen-SS . Similarly , a few years ago , the world was shocked to learn that famous Italian writer Ignazio Silone had , in his youth , collaborated with the fascist police .
Daily life under totalitarianism , be it communist or fascist , was routinely based on a deep duplicity whose effects are longstanding .
I don &apos;t agree with those who say we should not be interested in the dark episodes in the life of a great writer .
Why not ?
We should be interested not for prosecutorial purposes , but in order to gain a more profound understanding of a bloody , demagogical , and tyrannical utopia - and of human weakness and vulnerability . We may even consider it a rewarding testament to an artist &apos;s ability to overcome his past mistakes and still produce priceless work .
But can we justifiably defend morally compromised artists and intellectuals on the basis of their work &apos;s merit , yet condemn ordinary people for often less grave offenses ?
An egregious example of this was the way followers of Romanian philosopher Constantin Noica defended his support for the fascist Iron Guard and his later collaboration with the communists , while at the same time condemning even a generic cleaning woman for mopping the floors in the offices of the secret police .
Shouldn &apos;t that cleaner &apos;s drudgery to support her family , children , and her own survival be taken equally into account ?
Life under totalitarianism was an extreme situation that requires us to apply special , nuanced rules toall the captives of that ordeal .
In order to understand that epoch , we have to know and carefully judge often ambiguous and overwhelming circumstances , never simplifying a multilayered daily reality for the sake of current political goals .
If nothing else , in order to forgive , we have to know what we are forgiving .
In Eastern Europe today , old and young alike stand to benefit from that lesson .
Moses wandered with his people in the desert for 40 years , until they had rid themselves of the poisonous slave mentality .
Pope Francis the Politician
Buenos Aires - Jorge Mario Bergoglio - not an Italian , not a European , but a Latin American from Argentina - has now been chosen as the supreme pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church .
What , if anything , can Latin America expect from Pope Francis I ?
For starters , it seems clear that Francis will try to assert political influence in the region , rather in the manner that Pope John Paul II used his authority in his native Poland and Central Europe in the decade leading up to the fall of communism .
A former Jesuit , Bergoglio was raised in a religious order - founded in the sixteenth century to oppose the Protestant Reformation - that is known for its power inside the church and its desire for wider political influence .
So it is no surprise that Bergoglio has always considered politics , even from a religious point of view , as central to his work .
For example , he has been very vocal in voicing discontent with the rule of Argentine President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and that of her husband and predecessor , Néstor Kirchner .
He was active in helping to create a coalition of opposition parties to balance the overwhelming power of Kirchnerism , which has steadily been gaining power over Argentina &apos;s parliament , judiciary , and independent media .
Indeed , Néstor Kirchner once accused Bergoglio of being the head of the opposition coalition , and refused to attend a traditional mass - a Te Deum - because he was afraid that he would be the subject of the then-Cardinal Bergoglio &apos;s sermon .
He memorably declared that the church belongs to everyone , and that the devil sometime wears a cassock .
Kirchner &apos;s widow , Cristina Fernández , was clearly unhappy with the Papal conclave &apos;s choice .
When Pope Benedict XVI resigned , she shocked Argentine Catholics by joking that she would try to be a &quot; papisa , &quot; that is , if Princesses of the church were allowed .
When Bergoglio was selected , she sent a cold , formal letter of congratulations , expressing an aloofness that was entirely inappropriate for such a historic event for Argentina .
Kirchnerismo no doubt fears Francis I. Fernández &apos;s supporters know that Bergoglio feels closer to the United States than to any other world power .
This is not to say that they do not feel a similar closeness ; but they presume that a good relationship with US President Barack Obama would help Bergoglio to wield even greater influence in Argentina and the wider region .
Bergoglio is decidedly conservative .
He opposes civil unions for gay couples , and strongly defends the church &apos;s prohibition of abortion and its ban on women priests .
He is considered a misogynist , with views on women &apos;s role in society identical to those propagated by the church in the Middle Ages .
At the same time , he is ascetic and sensitive to the suffering of the impoverished .
He has always had very good relations with Argentina &apos;s trade unions ; indeed , he was a Peronist in his youth .
He likes football and mate , a traditional non-alcoholic drink that one consumes by sharing with other people .
But , lacking personal charisma , none of this may be enough to establish a strong rapport with common people .
The mere fact that Francis is Latin American is bad news for the region &apos;s populist governments - not only Argentina , but also Venezuela , Bolivia , Nicaragua , Ecuador , and Cuba .
John Paul II was one of the decisive forces in eroding the hold of communism on Europe .
If Bergoglio &apos;s Vatican is to succeed in rolling back the populist tide that gained strength in Latin America during late Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez &apos;s years , he will need to establish as strong a relationship with Obama as the one that John Paul II forged with Ronald Reagan .
Still , the moment may be ripe for him to exercise such influence .
The start of his Papacy finds the populist governments in a vulnerable situation , hit hard by Chávez &apos;s recent death .
They all , of course , have their own identities and strengths , but they will miss the protection of Chávez &apos;s global influence , as well as his subsidies .
Moreover , they rule countries in which Catholics are an overwhelming majority .
Although the degree of their religious commitment varies , they share a strong emotional attachment to the faith , which will provide Francis I with considerable political leverage .
Latin America will no doubt be one of Francis &apos;s priorities .
But first he must reestablish the Catholic Church &apos;s moral authority , which has been badly damaged by the scandal over numerous cases of pedophilia by priests , the Church &apos;s attempts to cover them up , and dubious financial practices , among other problems .
Only if he succeeds on the &quot; domestic &quot; front will he be able to exercise political influence &quot; abroad . &quot;
If he fails in this task , the high expectations that he has raised after John Paul II ( who addressed reports of pedophilia by dispatching them to the archives ) and Benedict XVI ( who was too feeble to act ) will turn against him and his church .
A League of Democracies ?
London - Senator John McCain , the Republican presidential candidate , has been calling for the creation of a &quot; League of Democracies . &quot;
This new international group would possess a formidable military capacity , based partly on NATO and partly on a &quot; new quadrilateral security partnership &quot; in the Pacific between Australia , India , Japan , and the US .
Neither Russia nor China , of course , would be invited to join : Indeed , McCain wants to exclude Russia from the G8 .
The League is necessary , argues McCain , because in matters vital to the US , such as fighting Islamic terrorism , humanitarian intervention , and spreading liberty , democracy , and free markets , the US and its democratic partners must be able to act without permission from the United Nations ( i.e. , from Russia and China ) .
In other words , the League &apos;s main purpose is to marginalize Russia and China in world affairs .
The most damning criticism of McCain &apos;s plan is that it would launch a new Cold War between states labeled democracies and autocracies .
This is not only dangerous , but incoherent .
Russia and China do not &quot; threaten &quot; the &quot; free world &quot; with a powerful ideology and massive armed forces , as they did during the Cold War .
Moreover , the world &apos;s democracies are themselves divided on how to deal with Islamic terrorism or genocide in Darfur : It was France , after all , which led the opposition in the UN Security Council to the US invasion of Iraq .
Moreover , on issues like terrorism , nuclear proliferation , and climate change , the US needs Russian and Chinese help . Stigmatizing Russia and China as pariahs will not get them on board .
( China must learn to behave &quot; responsibly , &quot; McCain declares with breath-taking condescension . ) In fact , Russia has mostly cooperated with the US in the &quot; war against terrorism . &quot;
Finally , the idea is impracticable .
One cannot imagine India or Brazil wanting to be part of any such a combination .
So we would all spare ourselves an awful lot of trouble if McCain &apos;s brainchild were buried as quickly as possible .
Yet underlying this idea is a serious proposition , to which Britain &apos;s former prime minister , Tony Blair , often gave eloquent expression : Democracies don &apos;t fight each other , so if the whole world were democratic , wars would stop .
Presumably , McCain &apos;s League of Democracies is designed to bring Immanuel Kant &apos;s dream of perpetual peace closer to realization by putting pressure on non-democracies to change their ways , by force if necessary .
Leave aside the fact that efforts to make democracy bloom have become bloodily unstuck in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Is it true that democracies never fight each other ?
The affirmative answer seems to depend on two separate claims .
The first is that democracies have , as a matter of historical record , never fought each other .
This is true of a rather small group of rich countries ( India is a partial exception ) , mainly in western Europe and its overseas offshoots , since World War II .
Moroever , they are &quot; our kind &quot; of democracy - constitutional democracies that contain all the features we take for granted in modern Western systems , not &quot; Islamic democracies &quot; like Iran .
A reasonable generalization from this rather small sample would be that &quot; prosperous and constitutional democracies tend to live in peace with each other . &quot;
The second claim is that these countries live in peace because they are democracies .
But is it democracy that has brought them peace and prosperity , or is it peace and prosperity that have brought democracy ?
Is it democracy that has kept Europe peaceful since 1945 , or is it the long period of peace since 1945 that has allowed democracy to become the European norm ?
The world already has a peace-maintaining institution .
The UN was created under rules designed to enable states of different political colors to live together .
Members accept the obligation not to use force except in self-defense or unless it is authorized by the Security Council .
The US is frustrated by not being able to get its way at the UN .
But the UN exists to protect all states from lawless behavior , including by the US .
By implicitly bypassing the UN , and dividing the world into two armed camps , the League of Democracies would increase the danger of war .
The world also already has a prosperity-spreading mechanism . It is called trade .
In 1994 , the World Trade Organization was created to liberalize trade under agreed rules .
It is full of faults , which need to be corrected . But we don &apos;t need a League of Democracies to do this .
By subjecting trade relations to embargoes , sanctions , and tests of democracy , environmental standards , and human rights , the League is likely to retard the growth of trade , and thus the chance for poor non-democracies to catch up .
The only purpose of the League of Democracies seems to be to legitimize war-making by democracies - in order to spread democracy !
This is the thrust of McCain &apos;s message . As he put it , the US was built for a purpose - to serve &quot; eternal and universal principles . &quot;
Its God-given task is to build an &quot; enduring global peace on the foundations of freedom , security , prosperity , and hope . &quot;
Noble rhetoric !
But if that is the League &apos;s purpose - and I see no other - then it is a danger to peace .
This is because its advocates believe that no long-term co-existence with non-democracies is possible .
This is crazy and unhistorical .
It is up to the chastened nations of Western Europe , which broadly share American values but have learned something about political patience , to rein in the American fantasy of re-making the world in its own image .
I am all for spreading Western-style democracy , but not at the cost of making the world more warlike .
Peaceful coexistence between different political systems is an attainable objective , and one to which all the world &apos;s major powers can sign up .
A Loan and a Prayer
New YORK - The countries known collectively as the PIIGS - Portugal , Ireland , Italy , Greece , and Spain - are burdened with increasingly unsustainable levels of public and private debt . Several of the worst-hit - Portugal , Ireland , and Greece - have seen their borrowing costs soar to record highs in recent weeks , even after their loss of market access led to bailouts financed by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund .
Spanish borrowing costs are also rising .
Greece is clearly insolvent .
Even with a draconian austerity package , totaling 10 % of GDP , its public debt would rise to 160 % of GDP .
Portugal - where growth has been stagnant for a decade - is experiencing a slow-motion fiscal train wreck that will lead to public-sector insolvency .
In Ireland and Spain , transferring the banking system &apos;s huge losses to the government &apos;s balance sheet - on top of already-escalating public debt - will eventually lead to sovereign insolvency .
The official approach , Plan A , has been to pretend that these economies suffer a liquidity crunch , not a solvency problem , and that the provision of bailout loans - together with fiscal austerity and structural reforms - can restore debt sustainability and market access .
This &quot; extend and pretend &quot; or &quot; lend and pray &quot; approach is bound to fail , because , unfortunately , most of the options that indebted countries have used in the past to extricate themselves from excessive debt are not feasible .
For example , the time-honored solution of printing money and escaping debt via inflation is unavailable to the PIIGS , because they are trapped in the eurozone straitjacket .
The only institution that can crank up the printing press - the European Central Bank - will never resort to monetization of fiscal deficits .
Nor can we expect rapid GDP growth to save these countries .
The PIIGS &quot; debt burden is so high that robust economic performance is next to impossible .
Moreover , whatever economic growth some of these countries might eventually register is contingent on enacting politically unpopular reforms that will work only in the long run - and at the cost of even more short-term pain .
To restore growth , these countries must also regain competitiveness by achieving a real depreciation of their currency , thus turning trade deficits into surpluses .
But a rising euro - pushed higher by excessively early monetary tightening by the ECB - implies more real appreciation , further undermining competitiveness .
The German solution to this conundrum - keeping wage growth below that of productivity , thereby reducing unit labor costs - took more than a decade to yield results .
If the PIIGS started that process today , the benefits would be too long in coming to restore competitiveness and growth .
The last option - deflation of wages and prices - to reduce costs , achieve a real depreciation , and restore competitiveness is associated with ever-deepening recession .
The real depreciation necessary to restore external balance would drive the real value of euro debts even higher , making them even more unsustainable .
Lowering private and public consumption in order to boost private savings , and implementing fiscal austerity to reduce private and public debts , aren &apos;t options , either .
The private sector can spend less and save more , but this would entail an immediate cost known as Keynes &quot; paradox of thrift : Declining economic output and rising debt as a share of GDP .
Recent studies by the IMF and others suggest that raising taxes , cutting subsidies , and reducing government spending - even inefficient spending - would stifle growth in the short term , exacerbating the underlying debt problem .
If the PIIGS can &apos;t inflate , grow , devalue , or save their way out of their problems , Plan A is either failing or is bound to fail .
The only alternative is to shift quickly to Plan B - an orderly restructuring and reduction of the debts of these countries &quot; governments , households , and banks .
This can happen in a number of ways .
One can carry out an orderly rescheduling of the PIIGS &quot; public debts without actually reducing the principal amount owed . This means extending the maturity dates of debts and reducing the interest rate on the new debt to levels much lower than currently unsustainable market rates .
This solution limits the risk of contagion and the potential losses that financial institutions would bear if the value of debt principal were reduced .
Policymakers should also consider innovations used to help debt-burdened developing countries in the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s .
For example , bondholders could be encouraged to exchange existing bonds for GDP-linked bonds , which offer payouts pegged to future economic growth .
In effect , these instruments turn creditors into shareholders in a country &apos;s economy , entitling them to a portion of its future profits while temporarily reducing its debt burden .
Reducing the face value of mortgages and providing the upside - in case home prices were to rise in the long run - to the creditor banks is another way to convert mortgage debt partly into shareholder equity .
Bank bonds could also be reduced and converted into equity , which would both avert a government takeover of banks and prevent socialization of bank losses from causing a sovereign debt crisis .
Europe cannot afford to continue throwing money at the problem and praying that growth and time will bring salvation .
No one will descend from the heavens , Deus ex machina , to bail out the IMF or the EU .
The creditors and bondholders who lent the money in the first place must carry their share of the burden , for the sake of the PIIGS , the EU , and their own bottom lines .
A Long March with China
Beijing - US Vice President Joe Biden &apos;s recent four-day visit to China ended on a high note .
He assured Chinese leaders that the United States is committed to honoring all its debts , despite its recent credit downgrade ; he talked enthusiastically about US-China interdependence ; and he showcased his granddaughter , who has studied Chinese for several years , as a future bridge between the two countries .
But , behind all the smiles and banquet Toasts , serious issues and perception gaps continue to divide the world &apos;s two great powers .
For starters , there is always an attitude problem .
To those who view China &apos;s rise in a negative light , the country is simply becoming ever more arrogant .
It is getting tough in its territorial disputes with Japan in the East China Sea ; it is becoming assertive in the South China Sea with its neighbors , also over disputed islands ; it put its own stealth fighter on display during the US defense secretary &apos;s visit to China ; it is sending its first aircraft carrier out to sea for trials , indicating the possibility of establishing naval bases in the Indian Ocean .
Even a brawl between the Chinese and a visiting American basketball team is viewed as evidence of China &apos;s aggressive behavior .
Many Chinese , on the other hand , tend to think that the US is suffering from severe case of conceited superpower syndrome .
As these Chinese see it , the US has a rather dysfunctional government , but nevertheless insists that its political and economic system is the best in the world , and that everyone should emulate it .
It is heavily in debt , but cannot stop spending and borrowing .
It is no longer competitive in manufacturing , but blames others for its huge trade deficit .
And the world &apos;s only military superpower is often seen within China as trigger-happy when intervening in other countries &quot; internal affairs .
Then , there is the issue of trust .
China &apos;s critics argue that its claims to a peaceful rise are not credible , given the country &apos;s non-democratic , one-party system .
Coupled with this is a zero-sum view of the world , in which any Chinese gain in the share of the global economy , or any increased presence in many parts of the world , must be at the expense of the US or other powers .
Any Chinese military move is portrayed as an expansionary and aggressive act that must be contained .
Any attempts at engagement by Western politicians , such as Biden &apos;s recent trip , are automatically met with doubt and criticism for cozying up to dictators .
Likewise , for those Chinese who are suspicious of US intentions , conspiracy is always in play .
They see a declining superpower using economic , military , and diplomatic means in an unrelenting effort to prevent China &apos;s rise .
Talk of human rights and democracy is nothing but a smoke screen for demonizing China .
Arms sales to Taiwan , Tibetan activism , and &quot; color revolutions &quot; of various kinds are all sponsored by the US and other Western powers , and are aimed at weakening China .
Despite decades of close interaction , with millions of Americans , Europeans , and Japanese visiting China every year and similar numbers of Chinese now visiting the US and other advanced countries , both sides see each other through a glass darkly .
Increased interdependence has not led to better understandings on even some of the most basic issues .
China &apos;s Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Fu Ying expressed her country &apos;s anxiety about this state of affairs in a recent interview . &quot; The most important thing is the question of whether China and the US are enemies .
Are we going to be in a war ?
Are we preparing for a war against each other ? &quot; Biden , while reaffirming that the US does not view China as an enemy , implied that Fu &apos;s worries are not fanciful , saying that the worst scenario is a misunderstanding that leads to an unintended conflict .
So the key issue for China , its neighbors , the US , and rest of the world is not how many aircraft carriers , missiles , submarines , and next-generation fighters China may produce and deploy in the coming years and decades .
Rather , it is how China intends to use its newly acquired economic and military strength in pursuing its domestic and foreign-policy goals - and how the world &apos;s leading powers can ensure that they do not end up harming each other by accident or misunderstanding .
To meet these challenges successfully , there is no viable alternative to a positive , continuous , and frank engagement between China and the rest of the world .
The Chinese economy will continue to grow ; the Chinese military will continue to modernize ; and the Chinese people will remain united in their Great Power aspirations .
A Cold War-style confrontation and containment policy from the West will be met with strong resistance from the Chinese , whose global leverage , particularly in finance , cannot be ignored .
Only a patient , creative , and consistent engagement strategy will mitigate fears on both sides .
China &apos;s rise is a fact ; the enduring peacefulness of that rise must be a priority for China , its neighbors , the West , and , most importantly , the US .
A Looming Anti-depressants Crisis
The widespread prescription of drugs for troubled minds has always ended badly , right back to the days of opiates and cocaine , up through bromides , barbiturates , and Tranquilizers : All proved to be highly addictive drugs , but only after years of denial did doctors admit that this was so .
Now anti-depressants--global brands with household names--are the problem .
The past decade has seen a three-fold increase in prescriptions .
In England , prescriptions of anti-depressants now match Valium at its peak in 1979 .
It is now clear that today &apos;s anti-depressants are not the wonder drugs they were touted as being .
The sometimes intolerable withdrawal symptoms that can make it difficult and hazardous to stop taking anti-depressants also expose many users to severe and depressing side effects : Substantial weight gain , loss of libido , and mood changes , to name just the most common complaints .
Suspicions about such problems--especially about drug-induced suicidal behavior and sensitization to depression--have been rumbling for years , but searching scientific investigations have only just begun .
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; An important inquiry set up by the United Kingdom &apos;s drug regulators in mid-2003 will soon report its findings .
They will no doubt be presented mainly as recommendations for small-print changes in the warnings on drug labels and in the instructions for the drug &apos;s use .
This may help , it but won &apos;t address the real issue : How could regulators have allowed this problem to recur after so much bitter experience , and why should they now be allowed to investigate themselves ?
On the Richter scale of drug disasters , the looming anti-depressant crisis appears to range between 7 and 11 , where thalidomide rates a 10 .
Time will tell , but the key point is this : The thalidomide disaster of the 1950 &apos;s and 1960 &apos;s happened because there was no independent control of drug safety , whereas the anti-depressant crisis has grown under theaegisof an elaborate , expensive , and global regulatory system .
The NUB of the anti-depressant crisis is not that these drugs could do so much harm , but that they were allowed to do so when the precedents were so plain .
If and when this crisis is ever properly investigated , it will not so much open a can of pharmacological worms , as expose questions about what medicine is and should be .
These underlying issues seem all the more important because the Internet has for several years been groaning with evidence of the crisis to come .
The explosive growth of the Internet introduced completely new opportunities for gathering , presenting , and communicating evidence .
It broadened and deepened understanding of the problems associated with anti-depressants , giving patients a collective voice , as never before .
Previously , drug safety monitoring relied on occasional adverse reports from health professionals about patients &apos; reaction to medicines .
But this crisis revealed these reports &apos; fundamental inadequacies , such that users &apos; experiences with drugs can never credibly be ignored again .
United by the Internet , many thousands of patients from all over the world began to describe experiences with anti-depressant drugs and problems brought on by withdrawal that bore little resemblance to the labels &apos; warnings .
The impact of this user intelligence has been profound : In 2003 , one pharmaceutical company revised its 2002 estimate of the incidence of withdrawal reactions from 0.2 % to 25 % ( even as the manufacturer of a similar drug continues to claim that it is &quot; not habit forming &quot; at all ) .
The anti-depressant crisis provides , for the first time , dramatic evidence of the collective value of user reports in understanding drug risk .
To be sure , user reports are not &quot; scientific &quot; and most , individually , might seem naïve , confused , exaggerated , mistaken , and / or just plain self-absorbed .
Yet in this case they provided , collectively , more reliable evidence than that reported in numerous controlled clinical trials .
So , now the question is not so much the value of patients &apos; reports , but the integrity of medical research and the state of science .
&quot; Just how tainted has clinical medicine become , &quot; asked an editorial in the British medical journalThe Lancet in 2002 ; the answer was &quot; heavily and damagingly so . &quot;
The duplicity surrounding the marketing of anti-depressant drugs underscores just how corrupt the profession has become .
The crisis now unfolding raises broad issues concerning democracy and science , the relationship between risk and benefit , and the conflict between imperatives of trade and health .
But one feature above all others captures the underlying problem : The yawning gap between the words of patients who speak their minds and the terminology of producers , experts , and authorities who mince words .
The 1990 &apos;s saw &quot; depression &quot; formally redefined as a serotonin-deficiency disease and the scourge of millions--a convenient and seductive view , but deeply simplistic .
The term &quot; drug dependence &quot; was also redefined , to propose that loss of personal autonomy could never arise in a therapeutic setting .
The ubiquitous term &quot; discontinuation symptoms &quot; --Orwelliannewspeak for withdrawal--implied that anti-depressants carried no risk of dependence .
On the contrary , wishful thinking led experts to adduce &quot; discontinuation symptoms &quot; as evidence of the effectiveness of vital remedies .
Later , suicides became routinely described as &quot; non-accidental overdoses , &quot; and the broad-spectrum term &quot; emotional lability &quot; came into vogue , despite its inability to distinguish between a drug-induced suicide attempt and an outburst of tears .
By contrast , user reports of adverse reactions attempt to describe some human reality , rather than promote images that suit the vested interests involved .
In the long run , the anti-depressant crisis thus may prove to be a blessing in disguise , but only if it brings about the transparency and intellectual honesty needed to make the medical profession ultimately accountable to the people it claims to serve .
A Man against the Machine
Washington , DC ­ - America &apos;s financial sector has shown renewed strength in recent months - political strength , that is - by undermining most of the sensible proposals for banking reform that remain on the table .
If we are still making any progress at all , it is because of the noble efforts of a small number of United States senators .
Most notable has been the work of Senator Ted Kaufman , a Democrat from Delaware ( yes , a pro-business state ) , who has pressed tirelessly to fix the most egregious problems in the US financial sector .
Kaufman understands that successful reform requires three ingredients : Arguments that persuade , the ability to bring colleagues along , and a good deal of luck in the form of events that highlight problems at just the right time .
On two fronts , Kaufman has - against long odds - actually managed to make substantial steps .
Long before it became fashionable , Kaufman persisted with the idea that the US real estate boom was fueled in part by pervasive fraud within the mortgage-securitization-derivatives complex , effectively at the heart of Wall Street .
This thesis is now gaining much broader traction - major newspapers now report a broadening criminal probe by the federal government - and by New York &apos;s state attorney general - into the US financial sector &apos;s residential lending and related securities practices .
With Senators Patrick Leahy and Chuck Grassley , Kaufman worked last year to pass a bill providing timely resources to federal law enforcement agencies working on recent financial fraud .
More recently , Kaufman was devastating in his cross-examination of Goldman Sachs executives .
Senator Carl Levin , chairman of the subcommittee that heard their testimony , evidently seeing eye to eye with Kaufman , was just as tough after a year-long investigation of Washington Mutual , Goldman , and the abject failures of bank regulators and credit rating agencies .
Kaufman scored an even bigger coup with his warnings about the dangers of the explosive growth of high-frequency trading , which is little understood by America &apos;s main financial watchdog , the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) , and poses systemic market risk .
His concerns appear to have been vindicated by the 20-minute shutdown of trading in New York on May 6 , when the stock market completely failed in its most basic function : Price discovery between buyers and sellers .
We do not yet know what combination of black-box computer programs and electronic trading algorithms , interacting across more than 50 market centers , caused this catastrophe .
But our lack of knowledge itself confirms how far our regulatory and surveillance capabilities have fallen behind &quot; financial innovation . &quot;
Kaufman &apos;s approach - with speeches on the Senate floor as a central feature - seemed irrelevant or even quaint to critics even a few weeks ago .
No significant Wall Street voices acknowledged his concerns - preferring instead to praise the equity markets as a shining example of well-functioning technology .
Now people get it .
As Senator Mark Warner graciously acknowledged , &quot; The Senator from Delaware sounded an early warning signal that the massive amounts of investments that had been made by certain firms to try to get what appears to be a fractional millisecond advantage in the trading process might come back and haunt us all ... I &apos;ve been proud to follow his lead . &quot;
The SEC was once a great and powerful independent agency .
It fell on hard times in recent decades and is only beginning to get its act together under new leadership .
Yet it still does not routinely collect the data that it needs - trades by time and customer - to understand the actions and impact of large traders .
Kaufman has consistently pressed them to do more - and do it much faster ; to be sure , they and many others are now listening .
On a third issue , the results so far are mixed .
Kaufman championed the case for making America &apos;s biggest banks smaller , as part of comprehensive financial-reform efforts .
His advocacy helped build support and forced a Senate floor vote on an amendment , co-sponsored with Senator Sherrod Brown , that would have imposed a hard cap on banks &quot; size and leverage ( debt relative to assets ) .
The amendment was moderate and entirely reasonable , yet it went down to defeat , 33-61 , also on May 6 .
It might have gained more support just a few days later - after senators witnessed the bailout of the giant eurozone banks .
Still , it has strengthened backing for another amendment , sponsored by Senators Jeff Merkley and Carl Levin , which would restrict proprietary trading by megabanks for their own account - coincidentally a practice that is presumed to be a large and &quot; dark &quot; part of high-speed trading .
The deeper and overriding point of Kaufman &apos;s critique of our system is the need for tough laws .
We cannot merely rely on regulators to do the right thing .
In particular , regulators have no chance to look over the horizon and act preventively when markets are opaque , and when powerful Wall Street interests ( and their Capitol Hill allies ) can circle the wagons and claim that there is no problem .
Unfortunately , despite his newfound prominence on the national stage , Kaufman will be out of office at the end of this year - he was appointed to fill Vice President Joe Biden &apos;s seat at the end of 2008 and committed at that time not to run for re-election .
When he goes , dangerous elements on Wall Street will no doubt breathe a sigh of relief .
Let &apos;s hope that by then he will have helped move the consensus permanently among his colleagues - preparing the ground for further congressional action aimed at a serious tightening of safeguards over the financial sector .
Kaufman &apos;s lasting legacy will be a simple and powerful idea that reasonable people increasingly find to be self-evident : Relying on deregulation and self-interest in today &apos;s complex , opaque markets will manifestly fail to produce a reasonable allocation of capital or support entrepreneurship and growth .
We must write and enforce laws that restore credibility to our financial markets .
A Mania for Diagnosing Bipolar Disorder
Providence , RI - During the past few years , many experts have suggested that bipolar disorder - a serious illness resulting in significant psychosocial morbidity and excess mortality - is under-recognized , particularly in patients with major depression .
Even patients who are diagnosed with bipolar disorder often wait more than 10 years after initially seeking treatment for the correct diagnosis to be made .
The clinical implications of the failure to recognize bipolar disorder in depressed patients include the under-prescription of mood-stabilizing medications , and an increased risk of rapid &quot; cycling &quot; - swings between manic and depressive phases .
But , perhaps as a consequence of concerted efforts to improve the recognition of bipolar disorder , during the past few years we have observed the emergence of an opposite phenomenon - over-diagnosis .
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; In my own practice , my colleagues and I have encountered patients who reported that they were previously diagnosed with bipolar disorder , despite lacking a history of manic or hypomanic episodes .
To be sure , we have also seen patients seeking treatment for depression who really did have bipolar disorder .
However , there seemed to be more over-diagnosis than under-diagnosis .
We therefore conducted a study to examine empirically how often bipolar disorder might be over- and under-diagnosed .
Seven hundred psychiatric outpatients were interviewed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV ( SCID ) and completed a self-administered questionnaire that asked whether they had been previously diagnosed by a health-care professional with bipolar or manic-depressive disorder .
Family history information was obtained from the patient regarding their immediate relatives .
Slightly more than 20 % ( 145 patients ) in our sample reported that they had been previously diagnosed as having bipolar disorder , significantly higher than the 12.9 % rate based on the SCID . Less than half of those who reported that they had been previously diagnosed with bipolar disorder were diagnosed with bipolar disorder based on the SCID .
Patients with SCID-diagnosed bipolar disorder had a significantly higher risk of bipolar disorder in their immediate family members than patients who self-reported a previous diagnosis of bipolar disorder that was not confirmed by the SCID .
Patients who self-reported a previous diagnosis of bipolar disorder that was not confirmed by the SCID did not have a significantly higher risk for bipolar disorder than the patients who were negative for bipolar disorder by self-report and the SCID .
Our findings , validated by family history , thus suggest that bipolar disorder was over-diagnosed .
Any study seeking to determine whether a psychiatric disorder is over-diagnosed will find that some patients with the condition do not have it upon re-interview .
Such is the nature of the imperfect reliability of psychiatric diagnosis .
The question , then , is not whethersome patients previously given a diagnosis do not seem to have it upon re-interview , but ratherhow many .
How high the percentage should be before claiming over-diagnosis is a significant problem and a value judgment .
But we think that an over-diagnosis rate of more than 50 % crosses the clinical significance threshold .
Over-diagnosis of bipolar disorder has costs .
Mood stabilizers are the treatment of choice , and , depending on the medication , they can produce potentially significant health complications affecting renal , endocrine , hepatic , immunologic , or metabolic function .
Thus , over-diagnosing bipolar disorder can unnecessarily expose patients to serious side-effects of medication .
The impact of marketing efforts by pharmaceutical companies and publicity probably plays a role in the emerging tendency to over-diagnose bipolar disorder .
Direct-to-consumer advertisements that refer individuals to screening questionnaires can result in patients suggesting to their doctors that they have bipolar disorder .
We have seen evidence of this in our practice .
This does not necessarily reflect a problem with the performance of a screening questionnaire , but rather how these scales are used .
Screening questionnaires maximize sensitivity , at a cost of false positives , because it is presumed that they are followed by expert clinical evaluation .
But insufficient diagnostic rigor can result in over-diagnosis .
Clinicians are inclined to diagnose disorders that they feel more comfortable treating .
We believe that the increased availability of medications that have been approved for the treatment of bipolar disorder might be influencing clinicians who are unsure whether or not a patient has bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder to err on the side of diagnosing the disorder that is responsive to medication .
This bias is reinforced by the marketing message of pharmaceutical companies to physicians , which has emphasized research on delayed diagnosis and under-recognition of bipolar disorder , possibly sensitizing clinicians accordingly .
The campaign against under-recognition has probably resulted in some anxious , agitated , and / or irritable depressed patients who complain of insomnia and &quot; racing thoughts &quot; being misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder .
The results of our study are consistent with prior studies suggesting possible problems with the diagnosis of bipolar disorder .
With the greater number of medications approved for the treatment of bipolar disorder , along with multiple reports cautioning clinicians against under-diagnosis , it appears that over-diagnosis has become a greater problem than under-diagnosis .
Both can have negative consequences .
While there is still some uncertainty as to the best assessment approach , we recommend that clinicians use a standardized , validated method .
A Marshall Plan for the Arab World
Rome - US President Barack Obama &apos;s major speech on the consequences of the Arab Spring is also a challenge for Europe .
Only if the trans-Atlantic partnership proves effective , as it did to meet the demands of the Cold War and the end of Europe &apos;s division , can the West contribute to realizing the hopes engendered by the Arab uprisings .
The crisis in Europe &apos;s southern neighborhood reflects a deep-seated transformation process that will have long-lasting consequences - for the region , for Europe , and for the world .
The Mediterranean region is vital to Europe &apos;s peace , stability , and economic growth .
The continent &apos;s Mediterranean neighbors look to Europe as their natural partner .
And events there , including the Israeli-Palestinian peace process , have a broader impact that naturally entails the close involvement of global partners - first and foremost the United States .
Current events , not just in Libya , but also in Tunisia , Egypt , Syria , Yemen , and Bahrain , mirror the political complexity of these countries .
They also spring from different factors , such as frustration with rising food prices and widespread corruption , coupled with demands for greater democratization , reduction of economic and social inequalities , and job creation .
Europe &apos;s response to this process must embody the goal of an orderly and rapid transition .
Proposals for some sort of &quot; partnership for transformation , &quot; based on political reform and full respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms , should bear in mind that the region &apos;s political landscape looks certain to remain volatile and tense in the coming months .
No surprise , then , that regional stability has emerged as a high priority for Europeans .
Chaos , a resurgence of terrorism , the rise of radical Islamism , and massive waves of immigration towards Europe are just a few of the potential threats to the European Union that are now being contemplated .
Given this , the EU should be doing its utmost to prevent any deterioration of the region &apos;s security .
Just as the post-1945 Marshall Plan consisted of a financial-aid package aimed at reconstructing and re-launching Western Europe &apos;s economies to support democratic transformation and political stability , the countries of the Arab Spring face similar challenges and needs .
We need to enable countries like Egypt and Tunisia - and possibly a peaceful Libya - to strengthen their political stability through democratization .
The Marshall Plan was accompanied by partnerships for reconstruction in which the US and European recipient countries were on an equal footing .
The aim was to strengthen cooperation as a means of creating a lasting peace .
The situation in the Mediterranean region is at a more advanced stage .
The broad planks of a partnership are already there , so what is now needed is to enhance Europe &apos;s integration with its southern neighbors .
This is why Italy has proposed a new EU &quot; Plan for the Mediterranean &quot; aimed at supporting the transition process and building upon existing institutional and financial tools to provide the region with additional resources .
The Union for the Mediterranean , launched by French President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2008 , must be revitalized and re-directed towards development projects ranging from highways and ports to the promotion of small and medium-size enterprises ( SMEs ) .
But a broader economic initiative is also needed to mobilize a critical mass of European and international financial resources to attract investment to the region and modernize its infrastructures and services .
Let us , together with the US , tear down the trade and economic barriers that are stifling these economies .
Let us also grant some Mediterranean countries association status that will allow them to integrate progressively into the EU &apos;s internal market and participate in EU programs .
To achieve all of this , a clear set of principles is required .
We Europeans must favor stability , create a real spirit of co-ownership , and promote political responsibility.In this new framework , the EU should avoid excessive conditionality , especially during the transition period .
Europe &apos;s strong support for the region &apos;s economic development must remain the top priority , as Arab countries introduce necessary reforms .
Moreover , a dedicated financial institution should be set up to aid in this task .
One proposal worth considering is to upgrade and strengthen the European Investment Bank &apos;s Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership ( FEMIP ) , which would become an autonomous institution , perhaps headquartered in the Middle East or North Africa , with shares held by the region &apos;s governments ( or other institutions ) and other willing parties .
The London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development could join this effort by extending its activities to the region , which could be coupled with the creation of dedicated services to support the growth of job-creating enterprises .
The EBRD made an important contribution to the economic transition process in Eastern Europe ; there &apos;s a good case for drawing on its experience and expertise to help the southern Mediterranean .
At the same time , the EU must launch a &quot; dialogue among equals &quot; on political and security matters , aimed at confidence-building across the region .
A Conference on Security and Cooperation in the Mediterranean and the Middle East ( CSCM ) could quickly become a useful instrument for promoting this comprehensive approach to security and development .
In short , we need to transform the Mediterranean countries into producers rather than consumers of regional stability .
We Europeans cannot afford to turn our backs on our Arab friends along the far shores of &quot; mare nostrum . &quot;
They are part of our collective history , and they deserve the better future that we can help them to build .
A Middle Eastern Union ?
Toledo , SPAIN - This autumn , the Toledo International Centre for Peace convened a meeting devoted to water cooperation in the Middle East .
One conclusion that emerged was that any effective response to the unequal distribution of natural resources in the region must be regional .
With this idea in mind , Munther Haddadin , a former Jordanian minister of water resources , proposed for the Middle East a &quot; Water and Energy Union , &quot; a long-term mechanism to integrate a fragmented region .
The idea is compelling .
Attending to such basic needs in a way that manages scarcities and surpluses regionally has a powerful logic .
Indeed , the parallels with the role of coal and steel in forging the European Union are clear enough that , over the past month , Joschka Fischer , Germany &apos;s former foreign minister , has called for such a union .
So , too , have former Czech president Václav Havel and a group of global luminaries who support the idea of regional integration through water .
Having convened the meeting in Spain , we are very much in favor of the pursuit of such a worthy goal .
But the European &quot; coal and steel union &quot; became possible only after Europe &apos;s major political conflicts were resolved .
A successful process of regional integration in the Middle East will also require a political framework that ensures the stability needed to make regional cooperation work .
All sides need to know where their borders begin and end .
And past injustices will need to be put aside , so that the cycle of revenge and the automatic reflex in favor of immediate gain do not scuttle regional solutions to problems .
Here , the experience of a previous regional exercise is worth acknowledging .
During the 1990 &quot; s , the multilateral track of the Middle East Peace Process pursued regional coordination concerning economic development , the environment , refugees , arms control , and water .
It failed , because when the bilateral talks collapsed , readiness to engage in regional cooperation withered under the despair of failed politics and the bloody reality of the Second Intifada .
The necessary political framework also needs to be regional and , fortunately , it exists .
The Arab Peace Initiative , first tabled at an Arab League Summit in Beirut in 2002 and reconfirmed in Riyadh in 2007 , provides all the parties with a framework to resolve their differences , as well as a political basis for moving forward .
Adopting it is essential to moving forward , especially if additional chapters addressing regional security and economic relations are included .
Despite today &apos;s chronic pessimism , the pursuit of a Middle East Water and Energy Union , coupled with adoption of the Arab Peace Initiative , would change mindsets .
Together , they would form a mutually reinforcing process : A political agreement would provide the framework in which the region &apos;s water and energy needs can be met ; and meeting these basic needs in an effective and innovative way would make the Arab Peace Initiative more than a paper deal .
Moreover , the arid triangle formed by Israel , Palestine , and Jordan cannot meet its water needs unless yet another dimension is incorporated into the solution .
A World Bank report has already stated that , with 19 million people living between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean by 2020 , water needs would not be met without making existing technologies of desalinization more economically viable .
Coincidentally , over the past month , there have been early signals of greater interest in a regional political approach .
The Bahraini foreign minister recently called for a regional forum that includes Israel to resolve the problems ahead ; a former senior Saudi official met with Israelis in the United Kingdom to reiterate the need for a comprehensive peace agreement ; and Israeli Labor Party leader Ehud Barak has said that it may be time to pursue an overall peace deal for the region , accompanied by an economic package , since separate negotiations with Syria and the Palestinians may prove fruitless .
Despite decades of effort , the process of trial and error through bilateral and conflict-management approaches has always ended in frustration .
Whatever economic projects have been launched has crumbled in the face of the persistence of the occupation .
The problems are too complex , and the dangers of radicalism too advanced , to permit success through haphazard means .
The Middle East can end its state of permanent crisis only if it builds a comprehensive foundation for peace .
The Arab Peace Initiative , combined with the long-term development of a Water and Energy Union , offers the necessary basis to meet the needs of the region &apos;s peoples and mitigate future conflict .
The Middle East must no longer be a hallmark of intractable violence .
It can be a herald of innovation on issues of common human concern - water , energy , and politics .
A Modest Proposal for the G-20
Beijing - In March , at a meeting in Beijing organized by Columbia University &apos;s Initiative for Policy Dialogue and China &apos;s Central University of Finance and Economics , scholars and policymakers discussed how to reform the international monetary system .
After all , even if the system did not directly cause the recent imbalances and instability in the global economy , it proved ineffective in addressing them .
Reform will , of course , require extensive discussion and deliberation .
But the consensus in Beijing was that the G-20 should adopt a modest proposal this year : A limited expansion of the International Monetary Fund &apos;s current system of Special Drawing Rights ( SDRs ) .
This proposal , while limited in scope , could play an important role in initiating discussion of deeper reforms while helping to restore the fragile world economy to health and achieve the aim expressed in the G-20 &quot; s Pittsburgh declaration : Strong , sustainable , and balanced growth .
We suggest that SDRs &quot; role be expanded through new issues and by increasing their use in IMF lending .
Doing so would build on the enlightened suggestion made at the G-20 &quot; s London meeting in April 2009 to issue SDRs equivalent to $ 250 billion , which was then quickly implemented .
The G-20 could suggest that the IMF issue a significant volume of SDRs over the next three years .
We would suggest , for example , an issue of SDR150-250 billion annually ( approximately $ 240-390 billion at current exchange rates ) .
Such a measure would have several positive effects .
First , it would reduce the recessionary bias in the world economy , especially during crises and in their aftermath .
Many countries continue to accumulate high levels of precautionary reserves , especially to avoid future crises stemming from reversals on their capital and trade accounts .
Recent financial crises have taught countries that those with large reserves are better able to weather the vicissitudes of international financial markets .
While such reserve accumulations help protect countries , in certain periods they reduce global aggregate demand .
Given its relatively small scale , the annual issue of SDRs would only partly offset these deficiencies , but it would nonetheless help sustain and accelerate global recovery without causing inflationary pressure .
Moreover , reducing the need for countries to set aside funds for reserves would also facilitate some reduction of global imbalances .
Ideally , additional issuance of SDRs would be accompanied by further measures to increase their effectiveness .
For example , countries &quot; unused SDRs could be held as &quot; deposits &quot; by the IMF , which the Fund could then use to finance its lending programs .
This should be understood as the first step toward integrating &quot; general resource &quot; and &quot; SDR &quot; accounts into a single IMF account , and to increase the SDR &apos;s role in IMF transactions so that it eventually becomes the main - or even only - mechanism for IMF financing .
During a declared crisis , IMF lending should be financed entirely by new SDR issues in unlimited amounts .
A working group could be established to study other reforms that would enhance global financial stability further and address other global economic and financial objectives .
For example , alternative systems of SDR allocation , with a greater proportion of SDRs given to countries actually demanding the reserves ( mainly developing countries ) , might contribute to global growth and stability .
One advantage of this modest proposal is that it would not prejudice the outcomes of the working group on broader reforms , like new distribution formulas for SDRs .
The issuance of additional SDRs , while contributing to global stability today , would not alter in any fundamental way existing monetary arrangements .
We suggest that this proposal be discussed at forthcoming meetings of the G20 .
The G-20 showed its effectiveness in responding to the crisis that erupted in 2008 .
The question today is whether , with the moment of crisis passing and countries &quot; circumstances and perspectives diverging , the G-20 can demonstrate the leadership the world needs in addressing its ongoing critical problems .
A failure to take concrete action would risk breeding disillusionment .
Our proposal would reaffirm the G-20 &quot; s continued leadership in ensuring greater stability and sustained growth in the world economy .
A More Perfect Monetary Union
Warsaw - The eurozone is often considered an experiment - a monetary union without political unification .
Those who make this claim seem to have in mind a model of a single state , which possesses two relevant features : Limited fiscal sovereignty for regional and local governments and a substantial common budget from which regions hit by asymmetric shocks can receive transfers .
Those who claim that &quot; political union &quot; is necessary for the eurozone appear to focus on the second feature , despite the fact that fiscal constraints on local governments are clearly a typical and important component of single states .
In this sense , they ignore the fact that the European Union &apos;s Stability and Growth Pact has been in principle an important component of political union , not its substitute .
Indeed , the eurozone &apos;s current fiscal problems do not result from the lack of a large common budget , but from weak enforcement of the Pact .
More fundamentally , monetary unions - in a broader sense - have existed not only within single states , but also in groups of sovereign states , the gold standard being the most notable example in history . The experience of such monetary unions offers two lessons .
First , they required fiscal discipline in the member states , which was true under the gold standard , with its informal norm of balanced budgets . Second , they existed without any fiscal transfers from a common center , because such a center did not exist .
Instead , a great deal of flexibility , including within their labor markets , facilitated adjustment to asymmetric shocks .
It is clear that there is no scope in the foreseeable future to extend the EU budget in order to increase fiscal transfers to eurozone members affected by sharp declines in consumption .
This would require an enhanced level of European identity , something which the Union &apos;s political elites cannot generate artificially . &amp; # 160 ; But the crucial point is not that a large common budget in the eurozone is politically impossible to achieve , but rather that it would not address the main problem : The weakness of the mechanisms safeguarding fiscal discipline in the member states .
Instead of looking at the wrong model - that of a single state - the EU and its member states should focus on the conditions required for the proper functioning of a currency union that has no common budget to compensate for asymmetric shocks .
First , utmost priority should be given to strengthening the mechanisms aimed at preventing pro-cyclical policies and large fiscal shocks .
This requires ensuring the credibility and transparency of the accounting rules that define budget deficits and public debt , with closer monitoring also focusing on the development of asset bubbles , which cause deep recessions - and thus sharp increases in budget deficits - when they burst .
Likewise , the European Central Bank &apos;s monetary policy should &quot; lean against the wind &quot; by paying more attention to the development of asset bubbles .
As the ECB &apos;s common monetary policy cannot fit the macroeconomic conditions of all the member countries , the eurozone countries need macro-prudential regulations that aim at reducing excessive credit growth .
Meanwhile , the Stability and Growth Pact should be strictly enforced , which implies using and strengthening the available sanctions .
To be sure , initiatives at the EU and / or eurozone level cannot substitute for stronger mechanisms of discipline in the member states , which are ultimately the responsibility of national politicians and publics .
But EU-wide measures aimed at ensuring discipline are necessary to spur the growth of preventive mechanisms in the member states , and such initiatives are largely dependent on the large countries , which thus bear a special responsibility for the developments within the eurozone - and within the EU .
Second , beyond strengthening economic institutions , EU countries must accelerate structural reforms to boost their long-run growth prospects and facilitate their smooth adjustment to shocks .
The former are necessary to help Union members grow out of their increased public debt , while the latter would help them to address unemployment .
Of the many necessary measures in this area , the most important include a vigorous effort to complete the Single Market , coupled with avoidance of economic nationalism at all costs .
Moreover , the Lisbon Agenda should be reinvigorated , with a focus on market reforms , and the EU should urgently reconsider measures - particularly regarding climate policy and the drift toward an EU-wide social policy - that risk imposing additional burdens on their economies and / or hamper the flexibility of markets .
In this respect , the mode of fiscal reforms is fundamentally important .
As EU members already have large tax burdens , further tax increases would weaken the forces of growth .
Thus , fiscal reform should focus on reducing the growth of spending commitments , which -given the aging of EU societies - must include raising the retirement age .
Finally , rigid labor markets and , more generally , regulatory constraints on prices and on the supply response of the economy , deepen recessionary reactions to various shocks , and contribute to the growth of unemployment .
Therefore , labor-market liberalization should be a high priority and another area of focus for the reinvigorated Lisbon Agenda .
European elites are fond of exclamations about &quot; European solidarity , &quot; &quot; social cohesion , &quot; and the &quot; European social model . &quot;
But no amount of lofty rhetoric can substitute for the reforms outlined here - or obviate the need for them .
Hardening Brazil &apos;s Soft Power
Brasilia - It is , perhaps , a truism for Brazil &apos;s citizens that their country is and always will be a peaceful one .
After all , Brazil has lived with its ten neighbors without conflict for almost 150 years , having settled its borders through negotiation .
It last went to war in 1942 , after direct aggression by Nazi U-boats in the South Atlantic .
It has forsworn nuclear weapons , having signed a comprehensive nuclear-safeguards agreement with Argentina and the International Atomic Energy Agency .
Through the Common Market of the South ( Mercosur ) and the Union of South American Nations ( Unasur ) , Brazil is helping to integrate the region politically , economically , socially , and culturally .
But is soft power enough for one of the world &apos;s major emerging countries ?
To be sure , Brazil &apos;s peaceful foreign policy has served it well .
Brazil has used its stature to advance peace and cooperation in South America and beyond .
Its constructive stance derives from a worldview that accords pride of place to the values of democracy , social justice , economic development , and environmental protection .
Brazil &apos;s unique approach to promoting these ideals is an important source of its soft power , reflected in the broad international support that placed Brazilians atop international institutions like the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Trade Organization .
Yet no country can rely on soft power alone to defend its interests .
Indeed , in an unpredictable world , where old threats are compounded by new challenges , policymakers cannot disregard hard power .
By deterring threats to national sovereignty , military power supports peace ; and , in Brazil &apos;s case , it underpins our country &apos;s constructive role in the pursuit of global stability .
That role is more necessary than ever .
Over the past two decades , unilateral actions in disregard of the UN Security Council &apos;s primary responsibility in matters of war and peace have led to greater uncertainty and instability .
Likewise , little progress toward nuclear disarmament has been made , in disregard of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty .
Brazil &apos;s abundance of energy , food , water , and biodiversity increases its stake in a security environment characterized by rising competition for access to , or control of , natural resources .
In order to meet the challenges of this complex reality , Brazil &apos;s peaceful foreign policy must be supported by a robust defense policy .
Brazil &apos;s National Defense Strategy , updated in 2012 , states that the modernization of the Armed Forces is intrinsically linked to national development .
Thus , it emphasizes the need to strengthen the domestic defense industry .
In accordance with the Strategy , Brazil is enhancing its conventional deterrence capabilities , including by building a nuclear-propelled submarine as part of a naval program commensurate with its responsibilities in the South Atlantic .
Brazil coordinates closely on defense matters with its neighbors , both bilaterally and through Unasur &apos;s South American Defense Council , which aims to promote confidence-building , transparency , a joint regional defense industry , and , most important , a common defense identity .
One potential mechanism for advancing these objectives is a South American Defense College , now under consideration .
South America is becoming a region where war is unthinkable - what the political scientist Karl Deutsch once called a &quot; security community . &quot;
Having visited every South American country in my tenure as Defense Minister , I am convinced that , the most effective deterrent on the continent is cooperation .
At the same time , Brazil is pursuing increased bilateral defense cooperation with African partners .
With our neighbors on both shores of the South Atlantic , Brazil is working closely to strengthen the Zone of Peace and Cooperation of the South Atlantic ( ZPCSA ) , which aims to keep the ocean free from rivalries foreign to it and from nuclear weapons .
Brazil is also reaching out to other emerging countries , such as its fellow BRICS ( Brazil , Russia , India , China , and South Africa ) and members of the IBSA Dialogue Forum ( India , Brazil , and South Africa ) .
For example , Brazil conducts IBSAMAR , a regular trilateral naval exercise , with South Africa and India .
More broadly , we are exploring ways to cooperate in the joint development of defense technologies .
Through such endeavors , Brazil hopes to contribute to a more balanced international order , one less subject to hegemonies of any kind , without losing sight of the importance of mutually beneficial partnerships with developed countries .
Even as Brazil hardens its soft power , it remains deeply committed to the path of dialogue , conflict prevention , and the negotiated settlement of disputes .
The presence of Brazilian peacekeepers in countries like Haiti and Lebanon underscores Brazil &apos;s contribution to maintaining peace and security worldwide .
In the twenty-first century , a truly stable global order will depend on a legitimate and effective UN Security Council , one that reflects the plurality of the emerging multipolar world .
China Grows Down
Hong KONG - For more than three decades , China &apos;s GDP has grown by an average of more than 10 % annually .
But former Premier Wen Jiabao rightly described this impressive growth performance as &quot; unstable , unbalanced , uncoordinated , and unsustainable , &quot; highlighting the many economic , social , and environmental costs and challenges that have accompanied it .
Now China must choose between the export-based , investment-driven growth model of the past and a new , more viable economic order .
Cheap credit and perverse incentives - such as promotions for officials who contribute most to GDP growth - have led to massive but redundant investment , which , in turn , has contributed to excess capacity in manufacturing and infrastructure .
This model is not only inefficient ; channeling government resources to support investment also undermines China &apos;s social development .
Given this , China &apos;s leaders have decided to stop using GDP growth as the primary criterion for evaluating officials &quot; performance .
Indeed , the 12th Five-Year Plan , which extends until 2015 , aims to shift China &apos;s economy to a new , more sustainable growth model based on quality and innovation , and accepts that annual GDP growth will likely fall to 7 % during the transition .
Most discussion of growth models nowadays is based on work by the Nobel laureate Robert Solow .
For Solow , GDP growth is determined by the factor inputs of land , labor , and capital , together with the economy &apos;s total factor productivity ( TFP , or the change in output not accounted for by changes in the volume of inputs , but by factors like technological innovation and institutional reform ) .
Since 1978 , China , by implementing major reforms , has achieved three periods of high TFP growth , each lasting 5-7 years .
First , in the early 1980 &quot; s , following the introduction of the rural household-responsibility system , which boosted agricultural productivity and released a large amount of unskilled labor to work in the higher-productivity urban and industrial sectors , annual TFP growth accelerated to 3-4 % .
The second such period followed Deng Xiaoping &apos;s southern tour in 1992 , during which he emphasized the need to shift to a market-based - albeit state-controlled - system by opening China &apos;s economy to foreign direct investment and establishing special economic zones to help develop export-oriented industries .
This time , TFP growth soared to 5-6 % , partly owing to the &quot; catching up &quot; process facilitated by China &apos;s adoption of foreign technology and know-how .
Finally , after major reforms of state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) and the tax system , China acceded to the World Trade Organization in 2001 .
With the country fully integrated into global supply chains , TFP growth hit 4 % , where it remained until 2007 .
Since then , however , the TFP growth rate has fallen by almost half .
Indeed , China &apos;s economy has experienced a significant - and ongoing - growth slowdown in the wake of the global economic crisis that erupted five years ago .
By 2012 , human capital &apos;s contribution to China &apos;s GDP growth fell almost to zero , with fixed-capital accumulation accounting for roughly 60 % of total growth .
Large-scale , debt-funded capital investments have raised the country &apos;s credit / GDP ratio to nearly 200 % , increasing the financial system &apos;s vulnerability - a development reflected in the recent spike in interbank interest rates .
In order to achieve more balanced and sustainable GDP growth , China &apos;s leaders must implement a set of deep , comprehensive , and long-lasting institutional reforms aimed at boosting TFP .
In particular , the reforms should be designed to facilitate China &apos;s transition from its traditional supply-based growth model , which assumes that building hard infrastructure leads automatically to demand growth .
In fact , GDP growth may be slowing precisely because existing investment in manufacturing and infrastructure , undertaken largely by local governments and SOEs , does not match the pattern of domestic demand .
As a result , China now faces the problem of short-term excess capacity .
Improving the quality of GDP growth will depend on Chinese leaders &quot; willingness to enact market-oriented reforms .
Rather than directly driving investment , the state must emphasize its regulatory and enforcement functions , including setting and overseeing standards , building an effective property-rights infrastructure , and managing macroeconomic conditions .
At the same time , the state must improve the quality and delivery of education , health care , and security , while minimizing corruption and administrative abuses .
In short , China must shift its focus from meeting GDP growth targets to creating an environment that fosters innovation and competition , thereby enabling market forces to set prices and allocate resources more effectively .
The state would thus become an intermediary agent , facilitating the development of a sustainable economic order in which less is more - that is , a system in which less intervention creates more opportunities for creativity .
SOEs undoubtedly played an important role in China &apos;s previous growth model , delivering the infrastructure and services that were deemed necessary for the global manufacturing supply chain to function .
But access to cheap credit from state-controlled banks creates an incentive for SOEs to generate surplus capacity , which increases systemic risk in the economy .
To correct China &apos;s excess-capacity problem would require the relevant enterprises , whether SOEs or private firms , to exit the market .
Unless China &apos;s leaders implement major structural reforms aimed at establishing a market-based growth model , they will be unable to avoid the &quot; middle-income trap &quot; that has prevented so many developing economies from attaining advanced-country status .
The deceleration in GDP growth that such reforms would cause would be more than offset by increased market dynamism and overall economic stability .
A Murder in Moscow
It is time to end the fiction that Vladimir Putin &apos;s &quot; dictatorship of law &quot; has made postcommunist Russia any less lawless .
The murder of Anna Politkovskaya , one of Russia &apos;s bravest and best journalists , a woman who dared to expose the brutal murders committed by Russian troops in Chechnya , is final proof that President Putin has delivered nothing more than a run of the mill dictatorship with the usual contempt for law .
This recognition is a timely one for the world to make , particularly Europe .
Germany &apos;s Foreign Ministry is preparing a policy on Russian / German relations that will enshrine indifference to Putin &apos;s lawlessness as being in the national interest of the most powerful member of the European Union .
But indifference becomes appeasement when it encourages Putin to pursue his lawless ways in the international arena , as in his current campaign to strangle Georgia &apos;s economy .
Googletag.cmd.push ( function ( ) { googletag.display ( &apos; Mpu &apos; ) ; } ) ; The killing of Politkovskaya has incited an eerie sense ofdéjà vu : Just as in the KGB &apos;s heyday , people simply disappear in Putin &apos;s Russia .
Politkovskaya &apos;s is the third politically tinged killing in three weeks .
Enver Ziganshin , the chief engineer of BP Russia , was shot to death in Irkutsk on September 30 .
Andrei Kozlov , the deputy governor of Russia &apos;s central bank who was leading a campaign against financial fraud , was assassinated on September 14 .
The fact that Russia &apos;s Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika , took over the investigation into Politkovskaya &apos;s killing , as he did with the murder of Kozlov , doesn &apos;t inspire hope , as such senior level involvement would in any real democracy .
In fact , the involvement of the highest level of Russia &apos;s government is almost a guarantee that the killers will never be found .
Politkovskaya &apos;s murder is a particularly grim augury when you consider that she was a powerful critic of Russia &apos;s President .
In her articles for one of the few remaining independent papers in Moscow , Novaya Gazeta , and in her books &quot; Putin &apos;s Russia : Life in a Failing Democracy &quot; and &quot; A Dirty War : A Russian Reporter in Chechnya , &quot; Politkovskaya wrote of the vanishing freedoms that are the signature characteristic of Putin &apos;s presidency .
As shown by the exile of the former media Tycoons Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinky , and the imprisonment of oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky , three fates await Putin &apos;s enemies : Exile , imprisonment , or the grave .
I am not accusing Putin &apos;s government of the contract killing of Politkovskaya .
After all , as a campaigning investigative journalist she made many people angry besides Putin , not least of which is the current Chechen Prime Minister , Ramzan Kadyrov , whom she accused of a policy of kidnapping for ransom .
But even if Vladimir Putin &apos;s associates had nothing to do with Politkovskaya being gunned down in an elevator of her apartment building in the center of Moscow , his contempt for law created the climate in which the murder was carried out .
Like the murder of Archbishop Thomas Beckett in his Canterbury Cathedral many centuries ago , the crime was committed in the clear belief that it would please the king .
Given what Politkovskaya represented - the responsibility of a democratic press to question the Kremlin and its policies - the government should have made certain that nothing bad happened to her .
Putin &apos;s Russia has already lost 12 leading journalists to murder in the past six years .
None of those crimes has been solved , which would not be the case if Putin &apos;s &quot; dictatorship of law &quot; was anything more than a PR strategy .
The six year period since Vladimir Putin arrived in the Kremlin has been a time of deeply conflicting signals .
On one hand , the world sees a young , educated leader pledging to modernize Russia , particularly in terms of bringing its law enforcement and judicial practices into line with international norms .
On the other , the president watches in silence while his ex-colleagues in Russia &apos;s fsb security service ( the former KGB ) provide no security to those murdered , and launch a series of notorious espionage cases against journalists , scientists , and environmental activists .
These &quot; neo-spies &quot; include journalist Gregory Pasko , arms control expert Igor Sutyagin , diplomat Valentin Moiseyev , physicist Valentin Danilov , and others .
The supposedly civilizing influence of being a Western partner - chairing a G-8 summit in Saint Petersburg for example - seems to have been lost on Putin &apos;s Kremlin cabal .
Once again exposure to Western values has delivered another Potemkin Village ; Russia presents a façade of laws and democratic institutions , but behind that cardboard surface the same arbitrary brutes rule .
The danger for the world is that Putin &apos;s lawlessness is being exported .
Across Russia &apos;s near abroad , a form of criminalized diplomacy is taking root .
Look at Putin &apos;s attempt to rig Ukraine &apos;s previous presidential election , and the on again off again criminal charges brought against the opposition leader Yuliya Tymoshenko .
Look at the rogue breakaway regions in Moldova and Georgia that exist only because of the Kremlin &apos;s backing .
Look at how the Kremlin seeks to blackmail its neighbors by threatening their energy supplies .
Every policeman knows that when you ignore criminal behavior , criminals grow bolder .
It is past time for the world to recognize Vladimir Putin for what he is : A man who is taking Russia back into the shadows .
So the world must now ponder that old Latin maximqui tacet consenterevidetur - silence means consent - and ask itself if it is wise to quietly consent to Putin &apos;s construction of a lawless energy superpower .
A Nation of Vidiots
New YORK - The past half-century has been the age of electronic mass media .
Television has reshaped society in every corner of the world .
Now an explosion of new media devices is joining the TV set : DVDs , computers , game boxes , smart phones , and more .
A growing body of evidence suggests that this media proliferation has countless ill effects .
The United States led the world into the television age , and the implications can be seen most directly in America &apos;s long love affair with what Harlan Ellison memorably called &quot; the glass teat . &quot; In 1950 , fewer than 8 % of American households owned a TV ; by 1960 , 90 % had one .
That level of penetration took decades longer to achieve elsewhere , and the poorest countries are still not there .
True to form , Americans became the greatest TV watchers , which is probably still true today , even though the data are somewhat sketchy and incomplete .
The best evidence suggests that Americans watch more than five hours per day of television on average - a staggering amount , given that several hours more are spent in front of other video-streaming devices .
Other countries log far fewer viewing hours .
In Scandinavia , for example , time spent watching TV is roughly half the US average .
The consequences for American society are profound , troubling , and a warning to the world - though it probably comes far too late to be heeded .
First , heavy TV viewing brings little pleasure .
Many surveys show that it is almost like an addiction , with a short-term benefit leading to long-term unhappiness and remorse .
Such viewers say that they would prefer to watch less than they do .
Moreover , heavy TV viewing has contributed to social fragmentation .
Time that used to be spent together in the community is now spent alone in front of the screen .
Robert Putnam , the leading scholar of America &apos;s declining sense of community , has found that TV viewing is the central explanation of the decline of &quot; social capital , &quot; the trust that binds communities together .
Americans simply trust each other less than they did a generation ago .
Of course , many other factors are at work , but television-driven social atomization should not be understated .
Certainly , heavy TV viewing is bad for one &apos;s physical and mental health .
Americans lead the world in obesity , with roughly two-thirds of the US population now overweight .
Again , many factors underlie this , including a diet of cheap , unhealthy fried foods , but the sedentary time spent in front of the TV is an important influence as well .
At the same time , what happens mentally is as important as what happens physically .
Television and related media have been the greatest purveyors and conveyors of corporate and political propaganda in society .
America &apos;s TV ownership is almost entirely in private hands , and owners make much of their money through relentless advertising .
Effective advertising campaigns , appealing to unconscious urges - typically related to food , sex , and status - create cravings for products and purchases that have little real value for consumers or society .
The same , of course , has happened to politics .
American politicians are now brand names , packaged like breakfast cereal .
Anybody - and any idea - can be sold with a bright ribbon and a catchy jingle .
All roads to power in America lead through TV , and all access to TV depends on big money .
This simple logic has put American politics in the hands of the rich as never before .
Even war can be rolled out as a new product .
The Bush administration promoted the premises of the Iraq war - Saddam Hussein &apos;s non-existent weapons of mass destruction -in the familiar colorful , fast-paced , and graphics-heavy style of television advertising .
Then the war itself began with the so-called &quot; shock and awe &quot; bombing of Baghdad - a made-for-TV live spectacle aimed at ensuring high ratings for the US-led invasion .
Many neuroscientists believe that the mental-health effects of TV viewing might run even deeper than addiction , consumerism , loss of social trust , and political propaganda .
Perhaps TV is rewiring heavy viewers &quot; brains and impairing their cognitive capacities .
The American Academy of Pediatrics recently warned that TV viewing by young children is dangerous for their brain development , and called on parents to keep children under two away from the TV and similar media .
A recent survey in the US by the organization Common Sense Media reveals a paradox , but one that is perfectly understandable .
Children in poor American households today not only watch more TV than children in wealthy households , but are also more likely to have a television in their room .
When a commodity &apos;s consumption falls as income rises , economists call it an &quot; inferior &quot; good .
To be sure , the mass media can be useful as a provider of information , education , entertainment , and even political awareness .
But too much of it is confronting us with dangers that we need to avoid .
At the very least , we can minimize those dangers .
Successful approaches around the world include limits on TV advertising , especially to young children ; non-commercial , publicly-owned TV networks like the BBC ; and free ( but limited ) TV time for political campaigns .
Of course , the best defense is our own self-control .
We can all leave the TV off more hours per day and spend that time reading , talking with each other , and rebuilding the bases of personal health and social trust .
A Neighborly Option for Iran
YEREVAN - Once again , the issue of bombing or sanctioning Iran has resurfaced .
For years , debate about Iran has oscillated between two bad alternatives .
Some are convinced that a nuclear Iran is the worst of all possible scenarios , worse even than the fall-out from a pre-emptive strike .
But neither a nuclear-armed Iran nor air strikes against it are wise options , certainly not for this region .
The repercussions of bombing Iran should be clear : Closure of the Straits of Hormuz , skyrocketing oil prices , possible retaliation against Israel ( regardless of the origin of the attack ) , and even greater turmoil in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Indeed , the only certainty of any pre-emptive strike is irreparable and long-lasting damage to regional security and political and economic stability .
Of course , the alternative is no safer .
A nuclear-armed Iran would change the entire region &apos;s security environment , and , given the enmity between Israel and Iran , two such nuclear powers facing off against each other would pose a threat .
The way out of this dilemma is to understand what Iran wants - and how to accommodate it without jeopardizing anyone &apos;s security .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said that Iran wants to develop uranium enrichment technology for industrial use .
Everyone agrees that Iran has the right to do so .
But the world is split over whether to believe that Iran is actually doing what it says .
If as some argue Iran is being disingenuous , then once it achieves this first phase - uranium enrichment for industrial purposes - it can easily slide into weapons-grade enrichment , leaving the international community out in the cold , with no channels of communication , no observation teams in place , and no monitors ready to sound the whistle .
That is why the world must not remain focused on the already-lost first phase .
Iran has more than 3,000 centrifuges despite all the international sanctions and threats .
Instead , the world must focus on the second phase , because it is weapons potential that is the looming danger , and it is here that internationally mandated mechanisms for oversight and supervision exist .
The Iranians have always said that they will continue to honor their commitments and open their doors to observation as members of the non-proliferation community .
But the international community must be more respectful of Iran &apos;s current industrial aims if it wants Iranian cooperation .
The first step is to assuage Iran &apos;s feeling of being besieged .
Fortunately , there are voices in America and elsewhere that advocate engaging Iran at the highest level .
But , to talk with Iran effectively , one must understand Iranian values and thinking .
Iranians have a sense of seniority , if not superiority , born of a rich and ancient culture that has survived into modern times .
But they also have a historically ingrained sense of insecurity , owing to frequent conquest and domination , which is being aggravated today by the presence of American troops to their west in Iraq and to their east in Afghanistan .
Their outlook nowadays is the product of these two worldviews - suspicious of others &quot; motives and proud of themselves as smart , tough negotiators and not without their own resources .
In my meetings with the current and past leaders of Syria and Iran , as well as in my meeting with Saddam Hussein , I heard them all say the same thing : The West is out to get them .
Their explanation was that the West is uncomfortable with the motives and behavior of ideological states - Syria , Iran , and Iraq under Saddam were states with causes - Islam , Arab unity , or anti-Zionism .
For Iranians , as bearers of faith and national pride , responses that seem to others self-righteous and irrational are , in fact , necessary and acceptable .
The case of Saddam &apos;s weapons of mass destruction is a historic example of a willingness to go to hell with your head held high .
Saddam knew that he didn &apos;t have weapons of mass destruction , but he was unwilling to concede the right of inspectors to ask .
As in North Korea , Iran &apos;s neighbors might provide the right mechanism to create a more transparent relationship between Iran and the world .
In the so-called &quot; six-party talks , &quot; North Korea &apos;s neighbors offered tangible incentives to Kim Jong-il &apos;s regime to abandon its nuclear program . The most prominent of these was an end to North Korea &apos;s economic isolation .
Iran , too , feels besieged , though it is not isolated : It depends heavily on trade , and not just as a seller of oil .
Two-thirds of its population is under the age of 30 , and unemployment is high ; it needs to attract foreign investment for its oil and gas industry , and to finance road construction and other infrastructure projects .
Comparisons with neighboring Turkey are instructive .
Before Iran &apos;s Islamic revolution , it led Turkey in foreign direct investment , income per head , and GDP growth .
Now Turkey has moved ahead , and may even join the European Union .
Other regional comparisons further reinforce that trend .
The Qataris have outstripped them in exploiting the huge gas field they share .
Tiny Dubai draws in far more foreign investment : Iranians go there for banking , trade , and fun .
Iran &apos;s neighbors need to convince Iran &apos;s rulers that Iranians , too , can participate in the region &apos;s growth , and even become regional leaders .
Only an open Iran , fully integrated into the regional economy and granted a role commensurate to its size and economic potential , will be able to moderate its siege mentality .
Here , a vital step would be for the West to begin to envisage Iran as a potential alternative supplier of gas , by offering to link Iran to the proposed White Stream and Nabucco pipelines that are currently under development to bring Central Asian gas to Europe .
The world &apos;s judgments about Iran &apos;s motives and actions should not be distorted by Iranian pride .
We can only understand Iran &apos;s real intentions by engaging the Iranians - not cornering them .
A New Approach to North Korea
Seoul - The long-delayed meeting of North Korea &apos;s ruling Worker &apos;s Party is now underway , and comes at a time of severe tension between North Korea and the international community .
It is widely expected that Kim Jong-il &apos;s third son , Kim Jong-eun , will be appointed to a key position and be publicly announced as his father &apos;s successor .
There are also hints that a reshuffling of important positions within the Party will take place , allowing the presumed heir to form a new power base .
Whatever happens , and whoever turns out to be the new leader , North Korea most likely faces an unstable future .
The cost of maintaining internal order will continue to rise as the system &apos;s fundamental defects force the new leader to confront stark new challenges .
Moreover , responsibility for managing that potential instability extends far beyond the leadership in Pyongyang .
North Korea &apos;s fragility is suggested by the fact that even such an important political event as the Worker &apos;s Party conference , held for the first time in three decades , was abruptly postponed earlier in September .
One cause for the delay could be a schism within the ruling elite , a group that &quot; Dear Leader &quot; Kim Jong-il himself cannot control as effectively as before .
Moreover , Kim &apos;s health problems might have worsened much faster than outsiders guess , further complicating matters .
&quot; Enough is enough , &quot; a mid-level North Korean government official recently uttered in a private conversation with a South Korean visitor to Pyongyang regarding Kim Jong-eun &apos;s likely succession .
Ordinary North Koreans , too , evidently seem to view this succession differently from that of Kim Jong-il &apos;s inheritance of power from his father , Kim Il-sung .
Moreover , there is no hope that any new leader , whoever it may be , will get any breathing space to establish unquestioned control , given the economy &apos;s utter state of decay , as last year &apos;s failed bid to reform the currency demonstrated .
The regime is under growing pressure from those at the bottom of North Korean society , and recognizes its own inability to handle the situation .
For example , for the first time , North Korea &apos;s prime minister publicly apologized for a policy error - the failure of the currency redenomination .
For the dynamics of the relationship between North Korea &apos;s people and its rulers seems to be changing fundamentally .
One troubling aspect of this change is that the new leader may feel the need to resort to brute force more frequently in order to suppress popular resistance .
And , at a time of domestic hardship and diplomatic isolation , North Korea &apos;s leaders , their confidence boosted by their possession of nuclear weapons , might try to distract their public through audacious , and possibly destructive , acts abroad .
The attack on the South Korean naval ship Cheonan earlier this year may be a grim sign of things to come .
Indeed , the North Korean threat nowadays derives more from the regime &apos;s internal weaknesses than from its aggressive external posture - the latter being the authorities &quot; fearful response to the former .
Unfortunately , however , most international efforts have sought to ameliorate the symptoms rather than cure the underlying disease .
Of course , in order to pressure North Korea &apos;s government to give up its nuclear option , the current international economic sanctions , which target WMD-related products and luxury goods , probably should continue .
But , at the same time , the international community should place greater emphasis on policies aimed at inducing North Korea to launch serious economic reform .
At a time of increased tension between North Korea , South Korea , and the United States such a policy may seem impossible to undertake .
Yet a road map for a peaceful transition can be designed .
If , say , North Korea is willing to respect international standards of economic behavior , it could be invited to join the International Monetary Fund .
Western governments also could permit charitable foundations to provide North Korean officials or students with scholarships to study abroad and learn how to run a market economy .
Of course , any assistance to North Korea would have to be monitored closely to prevent it from being diverted for military or other political purposes .
The international community would lose nothing by trying this approach and testing the regime &apos;s will to reform .
In fact , following the recent currency fiasco , North Korean leaders may have become more open to economic reform than ever before .
Such an approach is also compatible with Chinese policy , which has been to pressure North Korea to adopt its model of economic reform .
To be sure , North Korea &apos;s regime is not the only obstacle to international engagement .
Conservatives in both the United States and South Korea may argue that North Korea must first move toward denuclearization before any kind of economic assistance is offered .
But there is no reason why international efforts to ensure North Korea &apos;s denuclearization must preclude policies aimed at bringing about domestic reform .
We need not assume that these goals cannot be pursued simultaneously .
On the contrary , it may be impossible to win North Korea &apos;s assent to denuclearization in the absence of far-reaching domestic change .
The past two decades have shown that &quot; politically correct &quot; decisions do not produce the &quot; right &quot; results , even in the long run .
As North Korea grooms a new leader , the world needs to groom a new policy for North Korea .
A New Asian Security Constellation
New Delhi - Leading members of the governments of India and South Korea recently met to begin a new &quot; strategic partnership . &quot;
They are not alone in doing so , for across Asia , a new security architecture is being constructed , seemingly piecemeal .
How Asia &apos;s geopolitical landscape will evolve over the coming decades is not easy to foresee .
But it is apparent that an increasingly assertive China is unwittingly reinforcing America &apos;s role in Asia , restoring US primacy as the implicit guarantor of security and stability in the region .
There are at least four possible Asian security scenarios for the years and decades ahead .
The first is the rise of a Sino-centric Asia .
China seeks a multipolar world but a unipolar Asia .
By contrast , the US desires a unipolar world but a multipolar Asia .
A second scenario is that the US remains Asia &apos;s principal security anchor , with or without a third possibility : The emergence of a constellation of Asian states with common interests working together to ensure that Asia is not unipolar . Finally , Asia could come to be characterized by several resurgent powers , including Japan , India , Vietnam , Indonesia , and a reunified Korea .
Of the four scenarios , the first has caused the greatest unease .
China &apos;s neighbors are increasingly anxious about its growing power and assertiveness .
While China &apos;s rulers aspire to shape a Sino-centric Asia , their efforts to intimidate smaller neighbors hardly make China a credible candidate for Asian leadership .
After all , genuine leadership cannot come from raw power , but only from other states &quot; consent or tacit acceptance .
If leadership could be built on brute force , schoolyard bullies would be class presidents .
In any event , China &apos;s power may be vast and rapidly growing , but it lacks the ability to compel .
In other words , China does not have the capability to rout any rival Militarily , let alone enforce its will on Asia .
That fact has , however , done little to allay fears in the region .
With its defense spending having grown almost twice as fast as its GDP , China is now beginning to take the gloves off , confident that it has acquired the necessary muscle .
For example , China now includes the South China Sea in its &quot; core &quot; national interests , on a par with Taiwan and Tibet , in order to stake a virtually exclusive claim to military operations there .
China also has increasingly questioned India &apos;s sovereignty over Arunachal Pradesh , the northeastern Indian state that China &apos;s rulers call &quot; Southern Tibet &quot; and claim largely as their own .
Indian defense officials have reported a rising number of Chinese military incursions across the 4,057-kilometer Himalayan border .
As China seeks to translate its economic clout into major geopolitical advantages in Asia , a country that once boasted of &quot; having friends everywhere &quot; finds that its growing power may be inspiring awe , but that its actions are spurring new concerns and fears .
Which states will accept China as Asia &apos;s leader ? Six decades of ruthless repression has failed to win China acceptance even in Tibet and Xinjiang , as the Tibetan and Uighur revolts of 2008 and 2009 attested .
Leadership entails more than the possession of enormous economic and military power .
It demands the power of ideas that can galvanize others .
Such power also serves as the moral veneer to the assertiveness often involved in the pursuit of any particular cause or interest .
The US and its allies won the Cold War , for example , not so much by military means as by spreading the ideas of political freedom and market capitalism to other regions .
In the words of the strategic analyst Stanley A. Weiss , this &quot; helped suck the lifeblood out of communism &apos;s global appeal , &quot; making it incapable of meeting the widespread yearning for a better and more open life .
China has shown itself adept at assertively promoting its national interests and playing classical balance-of-power Geopolitics .
But , in order to displace the US and assume the mantle of leadership in Asia , China must do more than pursue its own interests or contain potential rivals .
Most fundamentally , what does China represent in terms of values and ideas ?
In the absence of an answer to that question , China &apos;s overly assertive policies have proven a diplomatic boon for the US in strengthening and expanding American security arrangements in Asia .
South Korea has tightened its military alliance with the US , Japan has backed away from a move to get the US to move its Marine airbase out of Okinawa , and India , Vietnam , Indonesia , and the Philippines , among others , have drawn closer to the US .
In terms of power-projection force capabilities or the range of military bases and security allies in Asia , no power or combination of powers is likely to match the US in the next quarter-century .
But , while America &apos;s continued central role in Asia is safe , the long-term viability of its security arrangements boils down to the credibility of its security assurances to allies and partners .
America &apos;s readiness to stand by them when the game gets rough will determine the strength and size of its security-alliance system in Asia in the years ahead .
The third and fourth scenarios can unfold even if the US remains the principal security anchor for Asia .
A number of Asian countries have already started building mutually beneficial security cooperation on a bilateral basis , thereby laying the groundwork for a potential web of interlocking strategic partnerships .
A constellation of Asian states linked by strategic cooperation , in fact , has become critical to help institute power stability in the region .
