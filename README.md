Toolkit for training neural machine translation systems
-------

This is a Tensorflow reimplementation of [Nematus]( https://github.com/rsennrich/nematus ). 
I used this toolkit for conducting my own research while I was pursuing a PhD at Edinburgh
University. 

This project was implemented with Tensorflow 1.0 - I have not checked whether it works with later
versions. 

The neural network model is an attention-based encoder-decoder model for neural machine translation
as described in:
